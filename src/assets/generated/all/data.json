Building on Gitpod's one-click, preconfigured cloud development environments, Ona layers autonomous AI \"agents\" that can plan, implement, test, review, and (with guardrails) deploy code inside secure, sandboxed environments. The platform is organized around three core pillars: Ona Environments (declarative, API-first dev environments with sandboxing and VPC deployment options), Ona Agents (autonomous AI collaborators that operate via natural language, IDE integrations, or automation pipelines), and Ona Guardrails (RBAC, audit trails, command controls, and compliance features for enterprise governance).
