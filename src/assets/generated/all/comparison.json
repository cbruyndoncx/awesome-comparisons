Amazon Q provides workspace analysis, prompts, and MCP integrations that can be incorporated into spec-driven workflows, but there is no evidence of first-class adapters or direct support for these named frameworks.":{},"Not applicable / no direct mapping: AskCodi is a developer tooling platform and LLM gateway rather than a spec-driven development framework; it does not advertise built-in support for any of the above SDD frameworks in public documentation.":{},"Augment also demonstrates spec-aware behaviors (e.g., checking edits against OpenAPI specs and service contracts) but does not publish a single public SDD framework name. For projects using Tessl (this repository), Augment's features (Next Edit, checkpoints, spec/contract checks) complement a Tessl-style spec-driven workflow.":{},"Not directly applicable to Brokk; Brokk is an AI-native code-assistant and does not prescribe a specific spec-driven development framework.":{},"Cline's approach centers on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), memory-bank files and checkpoint-driven iterations (plan → act → checkpoint → review). These mechanisms serve a spec-like governance model for automated changes and tool integrations rather than a named external SDD framework.":{},"HumanLayer / CodeLayer does not advertise a named spec-driven development framework like Tessl or BMAD; instead it emphasizes \"context engineering\" and battle-tested multi-agent workflows. Teams typically codify workflows via session templates, prompt engineering artifacts, and SDK-driven approval specs rather than a formalized external SDD framework.":{},"This project explicitly uses Tessl for Spec Driven Development. See .tessl/framework/agents.md and the project's Spec Driven Development documentation for detailed workflows and rules.":{},"Sources:":{},".tessl/framework/agents.md":{},"docs/spec-driven-development.md":{},"Cursor does not ship a native spec-driven framework. It can be used alongside external spec-driven tools and workflows (Tessl, SpecKit, etc.) but does not provide a first-class SDD framework out-of-the-box.":{},"No specific spec-driven development framework is used by DevoxxGenie upstream; development follows standard JetBrains plugin practices (Java, Langchain4J) and conventional release/versioning workflows.":{},"No public documentation indicating first-class support for BMAD, SpecKit, Tessl or other spec-driven frameworks; EasyCode focuses on planning/implementation flows rather than formal spec tooling":{},"Firebase Studio does not advertise a named spec-driven development framework in public previews; its development patterns are centered on templates, App Blueprints, and the App Prototyping agent rather than a formal SDD framework like Tessl or SpecKit.":{},"Not applicable — From021 is a SaaS product focused on product definition and does not advertise using the listed spec-driven development frameworks.":{},"GitHub Copilot Workspace implemented its own spec-driven workflow (Task → Spec → Plan → Code). This built-in approach functions as an internal spec-driven development method distinct from the listed frameworks; it produces editable specifications and concrete file-level plans which are then applied as code diffs and PRs.":{},"Copilot can assist in authoring specifications and code artifacts but does not provide explicit, built-in integrations or native support for specific Spec Driven Development frameworks (e.g., BMAD, SpecKit, OpenSpec, Tessl, AgentOS, ClaudeFlow, SPARC, SuperClaude) as of the last update (2025-11-04).":{},"No explicit, first-class support for community Spec‑Driven frameworks (Tessl, BMAD, SpecKit, AgentOS, etc.) is documented; teams typically export code and integrate with their own SDLC and spec tools outside Studio.":{},"GPT Pilot does not advertise one of the named spec frameworks; instead it uses a task/spec decomposition model combined with TDD and multi-agent roles (product-owner/spec-writer → architect → task decomposition → implementation steps + programmatic test goals). The workflow is spec-like (clear programmatic goals, user_review_goals, and auto-test generation) but implemented within the project-specific agent/task framework rather than a published spec-driven framework listed above.":{},"None specific: JetBrains AI Assistant is not tied to a named spec-driven development framework in public documentation. It integrates with IDE workflows rather than prescribing a particular spec-driven development methodology.":{},"No specific spec-driven development framework is documented for Jolt; the tool focuses on natural-language workflows and code generation without formally prescribing a particular SDD methodology.":{},"No specific spec-driven development framework documented; focuses on agent-based coding assistance":{},"Marblism does not publicly advertise adherence to a named spec-driven development methodology from the list above. Its product model centers on role templates, prompt-driven scaffolding and generated repositories rather than an explicit spec-driven framework like Tessl.":{},"MarsX follows a Micro‑App driven composition model rather than a named external spec-driven framework; the platform relies on self-contained Micro‑App manifests/specs (UI + API + DB schema) as the canonical unit of composition and reuse.":{},"Mistral Code is not tied to a single spec-driven development framework; it is designed to integrate with existing engineering workflows and can be used alongside SDD approaches (Tessl, SpecKit, etc.) via agentic automation and code generation, but it does not natively implement a particular SDD toolchain.":{},"No explicit support or built-in integrations with spec-driven development frameworks (Tessl, SpecKit, etc.) documented; treat as orthogonal to spec tooling.":{},"There is no public indication that Ona (Gitpod/Ona) is built around or prescribes a specific external spec-driven development framework such as Tessl or the others listed. Ona provides environment and automation primitives but does not appear to mandate a particular spec-driven methodology.":{},"PearAI does not appear to target or natively implement a specific spec-driven development framework. It is an AI-first IDE focused on contextual coding assistance, model routing, and extensibility rather than a spec-driven code-generation lifecycle. If teams use PearAI in a spec-driven workflow, they typically map their own specs/docs into the workspace via the @docs and project context features.":{},"Pythagora does not advertise adherence to the named spec-driven development frameworks. Its workflow centers on iterative generation, testing, and deployment powered by multi-agent orchestration rather than a formal SDD methodology. If integrating with a spec-driven process (for example Tessl), teams would rely on exporting the generated code and tests into their spec tooling and version control rather than integrate directly with a Pythagora-native SDD system.":{},"None : Refact.ai is a code-assistant / autonomous-engineering agent and does not itself prescribe a specific spec-driven development framework":{},"None — Refraction is a focused developer productivity assistant (refactors, tests, docs) and is not a spec-driven development framework":{},"RooCode is an AI coding assistant/IDE extension rather than a spec-driven development framework. It does not ship with a native SDD framework, though it can be used alongside any spec-driven workflow (including Tessl or custom spec tools) by operating on the same workspace files and automating edits based on spec requirements.":{},"No specific public spec-driven development framework (e.g., Tessl, BMAD, SpecKit) is documented for Runner H. The platform follows an agent- and workflow-driven architecture rather than a published spec-driven development methodology.":{},"No public evidence that SourceAI integrates with or promotes any formal spec-driven development frameworks (Tessl, SpecKit, OpenSpec, etc.). The product is positioned as a quick natural-language-to-code generator rather than a spec-driven development platform.":{},"[\"Sourcegraph uses a combination of RAG, embeddings and long-context experiments rather than a single spec-driven tool.\"]":{},"Not applicable — Supermaven is a developer productivity/code-completion platform, not a spec-driven development framework. It does not advertise alignment with or tooling for the listed spec-driven development systems.":{},"No explicit spec-driven development framework support; Tabby focuses on code completion and chat assistance":{},"Tabnine does not natively implement a spec-driven development framework. It is workflow-agnostic and can be used alongside SDD tools (Tessl, OpenSpec, etc.) but offers no built-in spec-to-code or spec-management features. Enterprise customers can integrate Tabnine into their development workflows (including spec-driven ones) by configuring model training, repository indexing, and IDE settings to align with SDD practices.":{},"Theia itself is an IDE framework and does not enforce a particular spec-driven development tool, but it is compatible with SDD workflows. In projects that use Tessl (like this repo), Theia can be extended to surface Tessl specs, run Tessl tools via tasks/terminals, and provide editor integrations (syntax highlighting, quick actions) for Tessl-managed specs.":{},"Trae is not tied to a specific spec-driven development framework. It integrates with project rules/metadata and MCP-driven agents so it can be used alongside spec-driven workflows (including Tessl or other frameworks) but does not formally implement or require one of the listed SDD frameworks.":{},"Conceptually aligns with outcome-driven planning and spec-to-code workflows":{},"Verdent uses a proprietary \"Plan-First\" methodology; not tied to community spec-driven development frameworks":{},"Void Editor is not itself a spec-driven-development tool; it is an AI-powered code editor. There is no native mapping to the named SDD frameworks (BMAD, SpecKit, OpenSpec, Tessl, AgentOS, ClaudeFlow, SPARC, SuperClaude). However, Void's prompt-editing, workspace awareness and Agent/Gather modes can be combined with external SDD tooling (e.g., Tessl or a spec runner) by using extensions or workspace scripts to enforce spec-driven workflows.":{},"Windsurf is not tied to a single, opinionated spec-driven development framework. Instead it provides flexible automation primitives (flows, rules, memories, extensions) that teams can use to implement SDD processes such as Tessl or other internal spec workflows.":{},"Zed itself does not ship a built-in spec-driven development framework (none of the listed frameworks are bundled with the editor). Zed is an extensible editor and can be used alongside spec-driven workflows or external tools (including Tessl, SpecKit, or custom tooling) via its extension system, Agent Panel tools, or external integrations, but no first-class, editor-native SDD framework is documented in the available sources.":{},"No evidence of specification-driven development capabilities (e.g., formal spec parsing or spec-to-code generation) in the documented jupyter-cogram extension":{},"app.build follows an \"FSM-driven generation\" approach rather than one of the named spec-driven frameworks listed. The platform uses a finite-state-machine + parallel tree-search + specialized-actors pattern to encode generation specs and orchestrate synthesis, validation, and repair of generated code.":{},"Bolt.diy does not natively implement a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) framework such as Tessl or GitHub Spec Kit. It is an AI-powered IDE focused on prompt-driven code generation and interactive editing. Teams can adopt SDD practices on top of bolt.diy (for example by keeping spec files in the repository and using the assistant to follow them), but there is no built-in SDD enforcement or formal spec workflow in the documented features.":{},"Bolt.new is an AI-powered fullstack development tool focused on prompt-driven application generation, not a spec-driven development framework":{},"CodeCompanion.ai is a desktop coding assistant focused on chat-driven workflows, not a spec-driven development framework":{},"CodeWP is not primarily a spec-driven development tool; it is an AI code generator focused on WordPress development":{},"Replit does not advertise a specific spec-driven development framework in its public Ghostwriter documentation. Replit Agent and workspace features can be used to implement spec-driven workflows, but no branded SDD method is documented.":{},"ToolJet does not natively implement a specific spec-driven development framework. It can be used as the execution/runtime layer for apps produced by spec-driven workflows, and can integrate with CI/Git-based workflows; but there is no built-in, opinionated Spec-DSL. Teams can adopt Tessl, OpenSpec or other SDD tools alongside ToolJet to manage specs, then implement/generate apps that run in ToolJet":{},"v0 is a design-to-code generation tool, not a spec-driven development framework":{},"Wrapifai is not a spec-driven development framework; it is a no-code tool builder for creating AI-powered applications":{},"Aider is a terminal-based coding assistant focused on interactive chat workflows, not a spec-driven development framework":{},"Claude Code does not ship with built-in support for any single spec-driven development framework by default. It is a general-purpose CLI assistant that can be integrated into spec-driven workflows (Tessl, SpecKit, etc.) via custom project files and scripts, but there is no official, first-class integration shipped with the CLI itself.":{},"OpenCode is not bundled with or tied to specific spec-driven frameworks (BMAD, SpecKit, OpenSpec, Tessl, AgentOS, ClaudeFlow, SPARC, SuperClaude). It can, however, support spec-driven workflows through Plan Mode and scripted skills—developers would integrate their preferred SDD tooling themselves rather than rely on a built-in spec framework.":{},"Warp does not natively implement specific Spec Driven Development frameworks (BMAD, SpecKit, Tessl, etc.).
