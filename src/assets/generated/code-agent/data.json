Inputs to the tool include the user request, a screenshot of the environment, and a history of recent actions.\n\nThe model has been powering several Google products including Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and some agentic capabilities in AI Mode in Search. According to the AI agent company Autotab, the model increased performance by up to 18% on its most difficult evaluations for reliably parsing context.\n\nGoogle's payments platform team implemented the model to fix fragile UI tests, successfully rehabilitating over 60% of test executions that previously would have failed.
