## Description
Codeium is an AI coding assistant that provides context-aware autocomplete, a conversational chat assistant inside the IDE, and a dedicated AI-native IDE called Windsurf. It focuses on multi-line completions, project-aware suggestions, and higher-level agent workflows (Cascade) that can plan and apply multi-file changes. It supports integrations with popular editors (VS Code, Neovim), Jupyter, and browser tooling. Codeium offers a free tier with unlimited completions and paid plans that unlock larger models, advanced context handling (Supercomplete), and enterprise features.
## BYOK
- No
## LocalOffline
- No
  - Codeium is primarily a cloud service; there is no widely documented offline/local model deployment for consumer users. Enterprise options are described at a high level but BYOK/local-hosted details are not publicly documented.
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - A free tier exists (unlimited completions for individual use); paid plans available for advanced features.
## GitSupport
- Yes
  - Integrates via IDEs and supports workflows that work with Git-managed projects (no separate Git-hosted backend required).
## Terminal
- Yes
  - Neovim support indicates usability inside terminal-based editors.
## Opensource
- No
## License
- Proprietary / Closed-source
## MCP-Client

## Notes
- Windsurf IDE and the Cascade agent distinguish Codeium from many inline-only assistants by enabling multi-file planning and larger-scope refactors.
- Security/privacy: Codeium advertises encryption and that it does not train on non-permissive data; specific enterprise privacy controls exist but BYOK/fully-local deployment options are not clearly documented publicly.
- Pricing: public materials mention free and paid tiers and enterprise offerings, but specific paid-tier pricing details were not publicly listed at time of research.
- Sources reviewed: Codeium marketing pages, product overviews and news coverage. For definitive enterprise, BYOK, or on-prem details consult Codeium sales/support or technical documentation.
