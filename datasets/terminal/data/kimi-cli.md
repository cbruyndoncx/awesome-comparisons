### Short Description
Dual-mode CLI coding assistant from Moonshot AI with 128K context window, supporting both traditional Shell operations and AI agent mode with ACP and MCP protocols.

### Description
Kimi CLI is a command-line coding tool from Moonshot AI that combines traditional Shell operations with intelligent AI agents. The core innovation is its "dual-mode interaction" design, allowing users to work in familiar Shell style while being able to switch to "intelligent agent mode" with one click using the Ctrl-K shortcut.

The tool features a large 128K token context window, making it suitable for working with extensive codebases. Kimi CLI supports Agent Client Protocol (ACP) out of the box and can be used with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE. It also supports the well-established MCP (Model Context Protocol) config convention. The tool is positioned as a competitor to Claude Code and other terminal-based AI coding assistants, with coding performance comparable to Claude 4.5 and GLM 4.6.
