### Short Description
An AI agent that brings Augment Code's power to the terminal, featuring advanced context awareness and flexible integration into developer workflows.

### Description
Auggie CLI is an agentic coding assistant designed to integrate into every part of your development workflow. Using Augment's leading context engine, it maps project structure, dependencies, and patterns without manual context selection. The tool supports both interactive and non-interactive use, making it flexible for one-off commands, piped input, or integration into build systems.
