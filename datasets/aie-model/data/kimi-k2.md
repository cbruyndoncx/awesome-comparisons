### Description
Kimi K2 is a state-of-the-art mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model developed by Moonshot AI, a Beijing startup backed by Alibaba. Released in July 2025, it features 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters, making it one of the largest open-weight models available. The model achieves exceptional performance in frontier knowledge, mathematics, and coding, surpassing Claude Opus 4 on multiple benchmarks and demonstrating better overall performance than OpenAI's GPT-4.1. With 65.8% pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified and 71.6% on full SWE-bench, Kimi K2 excels at agentic reasoning and real-world coding tasks. The model is cost-effective at $0.15 per million input tokens and $2.50 per million output tokens—significantly cheaper than competitors.
