### Description
GLM-4.5 is an open-source large language model series from Zhipu AI (Z.ai) designed to unify advanced reasoning, coding, agentic abilities, and vision in a single powerful framework. Released in August 2025, the flagship GLM-4.5 model features 355 billion total parameters with 32 billion active parameters, while GLM-4.5-Air offers a more compact design with 106 billion total parameters and 12 billion active parameters. The series demonstrates exceptional coding performance with 64.2% on SWE-bench Verified, surpassing GPT-4.1 (48.6%) and achieving an 80.8% win rate against Qwen3 Coder in real-world coding challenges. The model runs efficiently on just eight Nvidia H20 GPUs—half the hardware of comparable models. Available variants include GLM-4-Flash, GLM-4-FlashX, GLM-4-Plus, GLM-4-Long, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-AirX, all MIT-licensed for commercial use.
