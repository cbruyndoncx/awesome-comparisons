### Description
Composer 1 is a frontier coding model released in October 2025 as part of Cursor 2.0, specifically designed for agentic software engineering with exceptional speed optimization. The model's defining characteristic is achieving generation speeds 4x faster than similarly intelligent models while maintaining frontier-level coding results, with most coding turns completing in under 30 seconds. In direct comparison against Claude Sonnet 4.5, Composer 1 produces comparable or slightly superior coding quality while using less than half the tokens (200K vs 427K) and significantly less time. The model was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases, with access to production-grade tools including codebase-wide semantic search, code editing capabilities, string grepping functionality, and terminal command execution. To scale this training approach, Cursor implemented hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud, adapting infrastructure originally built for Background Agents and rewriting their virtual machine scheduler to handle high-volume, bursty training runs. Composer 1 is available exclusively within Cursor 2.0 and Cursor's CLI with no direct API access to external users, priced at the same level as GPT-5. The model demonstrates particular strength in multi-step coding tasks, large codebase navigation, and low-latency agent-based coding workflows. Cursor 2.0 introduces an agent-focused interface with three-panel layout displaying agent status, AI reasoning process, and generated code, enabling developers to manage multiple agents simultaneously and delegate coding tasks rather than writing code manually.
