### Description
GPT-5.3 Codex is OpenAI's most capable agentic coding model released on February 5, 2026, purpose-built for agent-style development workflows where the model can use tools, operate a computer, and complete longer tasks end-to-end. The model combines frontier coding performance with advanced reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities, enabling it to handle long-running tasks involving research, tool use, and complex execution. A defining feature is interactive supervision—users can steer and direct the model while it's working without losing context, collaborating like with a colleague. GPT-5.3 Codex provides frequent updates and progress reports, making it easier to manage and direct multiple agents working in parallel. The model operates 25% faster than its predecessor through infrastructure and inference stack improvements, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks including new industry highs on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0. Remarkably, early versions of GPT-5.3 Codex helped create itself—the Codex team used the model to debug training, manage deployment, and diagnose evaluations. The model progressed from writing and reviewing code to executing nearly anything developers and professionals can accomplish on a computer, including frontend work and real-world computer-use tasks. Co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, representing OpenAI's first model classified as "High capability" for cybersecurity tasks under their Preparedness Framework.
