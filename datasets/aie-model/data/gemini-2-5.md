### Description
Gemini 2.5 is Google DeepMind's most advanced model family announced in March 2025, featuring thinking models capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding. The flagship 2.5 Pro excels at creating visually compelling web apps, agentic code applications, and code transformation/editing, achieving 63.8% on SWE-bench Verified and leading LiveCodeBench for competition-level coding. Gemini 2.5 Flash is the most efficient workhorse model, improved across key benchmarks for reasoning, multimodality, code, and long context while using 20-30% fewer tokens. Both models feature superior speed, native tool use, and 1M token context windows. Building on Gemini 2.0 Flash (February 2025 general availability), the 2.5 family represents Google's commitment to developer-focused coding capabilities.
