### Short Description
Anthropic's fast, cost-effective coding model that achieves Sonnet 4-level performance at one-third the cost and 2x+ the speed.

### Description
Claude Haiku 4.5 was released on October 15, 2025, as Anthropic's latest compact yet powerful coding model. It delivers similar levels of coding performance to Claude Sonnet 4 while being one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.

With a score of 73.3% on SWE-bench Verified, it ranks as one of the world's best coding models. In Augment's agentic coding evaluation, Haiku 4.5 achieves 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance while matching much larger models in capability.

The model is designed to work in tandem with Claude Sonnet 4.5, which remains the frontier model and best overall coding model. A recommended pattern is for Sonnet 4.5 to break down complex problems into multi-step plans, then orchestrate a team of multiple Haiku 4.5 instances to complete subtasks in parallel.

Users of Claude Code find that Haiku 4.5 makes the coding experience—from multiple-agent projects to rapid prototyping—markedly more responsive. The model is available on the API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Vertex AI, and is rolling out in GitHub Copilot for Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise tiers.
