### Short Description
Google's most advanced foundation model with state-of-the-art coding and reasoning capabilities, record benchmark performance, and multimodal vibe coding features.

### Description
Gemini 3 is Google's latest foundation model, released on November 18, 2025, representing a significant advancement in AI capabilities. The model features enhanced reasoning, agentic workflows, and exceptional coding performance, surpassing previous versions across all major benchmarks.

Gemini 3 Pro achieves 76.2% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring coding agents' capabilities, greatly outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro. On Terminal-Bench 2.0, which tests a model's tool use ability to operate a computer via terminal, Gemini 3 scores 54.2%.

The model introduces "multimodal vibe coding," allowing users to visually instruct the model to make changes in code. This capability is available through multiple interfaces including AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini Command Line Interface tool, and third-party developer tools such as Cursor, GitHub, JetBrains, Replit, and Manus.

Alongside the base model, Google released Google Antigravity, a Gemini-powered coding interface allowing multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0. The public preview is available at no charge for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Gemini 3 is now immediately available through the Gemini app and AI search interface, with access worldwide where Gemini models are available.
