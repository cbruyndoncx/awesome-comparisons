### Description
Claude Sonnet 4.5 is Anthropic's best coding model, released on September 29, 2025, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation for real-world software coding abilities. The model can run autonomously for up to 30 hours—a significant leap from Claude Opus 4's seven hours—during which it can build complete applications, stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform SOC 2 security audits. Most remarkably, Claude Sonnet 4.5's code editing capabilities improved from Sonnet 4's 9% error rate to 0% on Anthropic's internal benchmarks. Despite being smaller than Claude Opus 4.1, it outperforms it in "almost every single way" according to Anthropic's chief product officer. Available at the same pricing as Sonnet 4 ($3/$15 per million tokens) and integrated into major coding tools including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf.
