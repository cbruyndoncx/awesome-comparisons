### Description
GPT-5.2 Codex is OpenAI's most advanced agentic coding model released on December 18, 2025, designed specifically for professional software engineering and defensive cybersecurity work. The model combines improved long-context understanding, reliable tool execution, and specialized security capabilities into a single powerful system. GPT-5.2 Codex excels at extended coding sessions in large repositories, maintaining full context integrity across complex tasks and reliably completing long-running work such as large refactors, code migrations, and feature builds—continuing to iterate without losing track even when plans change or attempts fail. The model achieves superior long-context understanding through native context compaction, making it more token-efficient in its reasoning while handling substantially more information, with the underlying GPT-5.2 demonstrating near 100% accuracy on deep document analysis tasks spanning hundreds of thousands of tokens. Enhanced vision performance enables accurate interpretation of screenshots, technical diagrams, charts, and UI surfaces, translating design mockups into functional prototypes. GPT-5.2 Codex delivers significantly improved performance in native Windows environments and provides improved reliability in tool calling with stronger performance on complex coding workflows. A distinguishing characteristic is enhanced cybersecurity capabilities including specialized training for defensive cybersecurity work, product-level safeguards with sandboxing and configurable network access, and invite-only trusted access for vetted professionals focused on defensive cybersecurity research. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, demonstrating dramatic performance improvements across successive versions on cybersecurity evaluations.
