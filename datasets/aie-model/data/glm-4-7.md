### Description
GLM-4.7 is Zhipu AI's latest-generation flagship large language model, released December 2025, utilizing a Mixture of Experts architecture with 355B total parameters and 32B activated parameters per token. The model supports a 200K-205K token context window with up to 128K output tokens, enabling processing of entire codebases and generating comprehensive multi-file software modules in a single response. GLM-4.7 excels at agentic coding, decomposing high-level requirements into executable steps and handling complete task lifecycles. It achieves 73.8% on SWE-bench (5.8% improvement over GLM-4.6) and 66.7% on SWE-bench Multilingual (nearly 13% gain). The model is natively bilingual in English and Chinese with Chain of Thought reasoning for transparent problem-solving. A Flash variant is available optimized for low-latency inference.
