### Description
Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's flagship model released on November 24, 2025, as part of the Claude 4.5 family spanning September through November 2025. The model became the first AI to break the 80% threshold on SWE-bench Verified, achieving 80.9%—a 65% improvement over Claude 3.5 Sonnet and surpassing GPT-5.2 (approximately 70%) and Gemini 3 Pro (approximately 65%). With a 200,000 token context window and 64,000 token output capacity, Opus 4.5 automatically preserves all previous thinking blocks throughout conversations, maintaining reasoning continuity across extended multi-turn interactions. A unique effort parameter allows developers to control token usage—at medium effort, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5's best performance while using 76% fewer output tokens; at high effort, it exceeds Sonnet 4.5 by 4.3 percentage points while using 48% fewer tokens. The model introduces a new zoom action for enhanced computer use, enabling detailed inspection of specific screen regions at full resolution for examining fine-grained UI elements. Opus 4.5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on complex enterprise tasks with 15% improvement over Sonnet 4.5 on Terminal Bench and achieves higher pass rates while using up to 65% fewer tokens in autonomous coding sessions. The model represents a breakthrough in self-improving AI agents—achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn't match that quality after 10 iterations. Pricing is set at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, representing a 67% reduction compared to previous Opus models while delivering superior performance and token efficiency.
