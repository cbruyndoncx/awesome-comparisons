### Description
Claude Opus 4.6 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, released on February 5, 2026, designed for complex coding, agentic workflows, and high-stakes enterprise applications. The model features a 1M token context window in beta (approximately 750,000 words), supporting up to 128k output tokens—double the previous limit. A groundbreaking agent teams feature allows multiple agents to work in parallel and coordinate autonomously on separate tasks, significantly accelerating complex workflows. Opus 4.6 excels at agentic coding with improved planning capabilities, breaking complex tasks into independent subtasks while running tools and subagents in parallel. Long-context performance improved dramatically with 76% on MRCR v2 benchmark versus 18.5% for its predecessor. The model demonstrates enhanced debugging and code review skills, catching its own mistakes and working reliably in larger codebases. New features include adaptive thinking that adjusts based on task complexity, max effort parameter for highest capability, Compaction API for effectively infinite conversations, and data residency controls. Available across claude.ai, Claude API, major cloud platforms, and GitHub Copilot. Pricing remains at $5/$25 per million input/output tokens with premium pricing ($10/$37.50) for prompts exceeding 200k tokens.
