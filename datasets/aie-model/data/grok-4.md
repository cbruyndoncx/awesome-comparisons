### Short Description
- xAI's most advanced model trained on 200,000 GPU Colossus cluster with reinforcement learning at pretraining scale, featuring native tool use and specialized coding variant Grok Code Fast 1.

### Description
Grok 4 is xAI's flagship AI model released on July 9, 2025, described as "the most intelligent model in the world." Trained using Colossus, xAI's 200,000 GPU cluster, Grok 4 runs reinforcement learning at pretraining scale to refine its reasoning abilities. The model features native tool use and real-time search integration, making it particularly effective for dynamic information retrieval and complex task execution. On August 28, 2025, xAI released Grok Code Fast 1, a specialized coding variant that excels at agentic coding, initially offered free on GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code, opencode, and Windsurf. Grok 3 (the predecessor) achieved 79.4-80.4% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating strong coding capabilities inherited by Grok 4.
