### Description
Cogram.ai is an AI assistant focused on accelerating data-science work in Jupyter Notebooks. It generates or autocompletes Python code from natural-language comments, offers code explanations, and can help convert English queries into SQL. The tool is distributed as a Jupyter extension (pip-installable) and requires an API token obtained by signing up on cogram.ai.

### Languages
- Python

### Notes
- Two different Cogram products exist: cogram.ai (coding assistant) and cogram.com (construction / meeting docs). Make sure to confirm which product you mean.
- Installation references: pip package and Jupyter nbextension (users sign up for an API token). Example pip install: `pip install -U jupyter-cogram` (community references).
- Official BYOK and enterprise privacy guarantees for cogram.ai were not found in public docs; some enterprise / privacy language appears associated with the other Cogram product (construction), so exercise caution when evaluating privacy claims.
- No official open-source repository for cogram.ai discovered; community/test repos exist but appear unofficial.
