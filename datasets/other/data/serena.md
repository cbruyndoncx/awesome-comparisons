### Short Description
- Open-source coding agent toolkit with semantic code analysis via LSP integration, distributed as an MCP server for Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI assistants.

### Description
Serena is an innovative open-source coding agent toolkit that emerged in 2025, providing semantic code understanding and intelligent editing capabilities through language server integration. Built on the widely-implemented Language Server Protocol (LSP), Serena enables AI models to work with symbol-level operations rather than reading entire files or performing basic string manipulations. It supports language servers for Python, Java, TypeScript, and other languages, enabling sophisticated symbol-level understanding and code manipulation. Designed as a free alternative to expensive coding assistants, Serena is distributed primarily as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, VSCode, and other AI platforms.

### Languages
- Any
  - Primary support for Python, Java, TypeScript through LSP

### Notes
- LSP-based semantic analysis: Uses Language Server Protocol for symbol-level code understanding and manipulation.
- MCP server implementation: Distributed as an MCP server that integrates with multiple AI coding platforms.
- Symbol-level operations: Enables AI models to work with code at the symbol level rather than text/string level.
- Multi-language support: Works with any language that has an LSP implementation.
- Shell command execution: Can run tests, linters, build scripts with explicit permission control.
- Free and open-source: Designed as accessible alternative to proprietary coding assistants.
- Wide integration: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, VSCode, ChatGPT (via mcpo), and others.
- Developer: Created by oraios with strong community adoption.
- Emerged in 2025 as a key infrastructure tool for AI coding.
