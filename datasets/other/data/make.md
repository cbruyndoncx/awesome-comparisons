### Short Description
Visual workflow automation platform with native MCP Client module for connecting to external MCP servers and orchestrating AI-powered automations across 2,000+ integrations.

### Description
Make (formerly Integromat) is a cloud-based visual automation platform that enables users to design, build, and automate workflows across thousands of applications without writing code. The platform features a drag-and-drop interface where automation workflows (called "scenarios") can be visually constructed using pre-built modules for over 2,000 integrations including GitHub, Slack, Google Workspace, Salesforce, and more. Make's visual builder uses a flowchart-style approach with routers, filters, and error handling, making complex multi-step automations accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

Make provides dual MCP integration through both an MCP Client and MCP Server. The Make MCP Client module (available on all paid plans) enables scenarios to call tools hosted on external MCP-compliant servers without requiring raw API calls, local hosting, or external infrastructure. Users can add the MCP Client module to any scenario, point it to an MCP server URL (such as Asana, PayPal, Webflow, or GitHub), and visually map inputs using auto-rendered fields with schema validation and help texts. The client can execute specific tools directly or use AI to automatically select and run the required tools for a given task.

The complementary Make MCP Server (open source, MIT licensed on GitHub) exposes Make scenarios as tools that external AI systems like Claude Desktop or ChatGPT can discover and execute. Any scenario marked as "on demand" becomes instantly accessible to connected AI agents via the Model Context Protocol, creating bidirectional communication between AI assistants and Make's automation workflows. Together, these capabilities position Make as a no-code orchestration layer for AI-powered automation.
