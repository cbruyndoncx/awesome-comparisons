### Short Description
- Desktop GUI wrapper for Aider featuring automatic IDE sync with IntelliJ IDEA/VSCode plugins, autonomous agent mode, and comprehensive task management with cost tracking and Git worktree isolation.

### Description
AiderDesk is a sophisticated desktop application that brings all the power of Aider's terminal-based AI pair programming into a user-friendly graphical interface. Built as a separate project from the core Aider CLI tool, AiderDesk enhances the developer experience with automatic IDE synchronization through IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode plugins that automatically add/remove the currently active file(s) to/from the context. Tasks include chat history, context files, cost tracking, todo lists, and optional Git worktree isolation for safer experimentation. The platform features a powerful Agent Mode utilizing an autonomous AI agent (powered by Vercel AI SDK) capable of complex task planning and execution using various tools, making it ideal for developers who prefer GUI workflows over terminal interactions.
