High-speed AI coding agent powered by Cerebras delivering 2000 tokens/second, with enterprise-focused capabilities, plan mode with deepResearch, and MCP ecosystem integration.

### Description
Cheetah AI is an AI-powered coding agent platform launched in 2025 that emphasizes exceptional speed and enterprise-level complexity handling. The platform features code generation at 2000 tokens per second through Cerebras-powered high-speed inference, positioning it as one of the fastest AI coding assistants available.

The platform is designed for enterprise-level complexity rather than toy projects, featuring a dedicated plan mode integrated with deepResearch to create detailed specifications. It extends capabilities through powerful tools from the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem, enabling integration with various development tools and workflows.

According to performance analyses, Cheetah AI delivers 230% ROI for engineering teams through time savings and productivity improvements. The platform offers competitive pricing at $1.25 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. Early users report that it feels responsive and well-suited for coding tasks, though its underlying model provider remains undisclosed in some materials.
