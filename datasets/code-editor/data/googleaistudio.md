## Description
Google AI Studio is a web-based IDE and playground from Google that exposes the Gemini family of models (text, multimodal/vision, and Live/voice-enabled variants) through a unified, multimodal workflow. It aims to let developers, researchers and product teams prototype interactions that combine text, images, voice, screen-sharing and external context (URLs, Maps grounding) and then export working client/server snippets to accelerate production integration. The environment is primarily browser-hosted and intended for quick iteration, A/B style model comparisons, and as a stepping stone into Google Cloud's Vertex AI for enterprise scale.
## BYOK

## LocalOffline
- No
  - Studio is a cloud-hosted web application; there is no known supported offline/self-hosted distribution of the Studio UI or Gemini models.
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Core prototyping and experimentation features of AI Studio are available without charge. 
## GitSupport
- No
  - Studio offers code export but does not act as a git host. Exported snippets are intended to be copied into developer repositories.
## Terminal
- No
  - Interaction is through the web UI (Playground, chat, multimodal inputs) and exported code; no integrated shell/terminal is advertised.
## Opensource
- No
  - Studio and Gemini are proprietary Google services; there are no public source repositories for the hosted Studio environment.
## License
- Proprietary
## MCP-Client

## Notes
- Multimodal strength: first-class support for text, images, voice, camera and screen-sharing makes Studio a powerful prototyping environment for rich interactions.
- Live and device-specific features: some Live/voice/screen features are available only on supported mobile devices (newer Android flagships) and via Chrome on desktop; capabilities and stability can vary by platform.
- Code export: Studio generates runnable SDK snippets (Python, Node.js, mobile SDKs) to help move experiments to production quickly.
- Vertex AI path: clear migration/upgrade path to Vertex AI for organizations that need enterprise controls, data governance and scalable deployment.
- Pricing & enterprise details: core Studio use is free for prototyping, but Google documents and community reports indicate advanced grounding or high-volume production may incur costsâ€”validate with Google Cloud sales or the Vertex AI pricing pages for production plans.
- BYOK / data residency: no public documentation found indicating BYOK or self-hosted Gemini; expect data to be processed in Google Cloud unless an enterprise contract or Vertex AI offering provides specific guarantees.
