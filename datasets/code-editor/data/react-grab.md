### Short Description
Developer tool enabling AI coding assistants to interact with elements in React applications by providing visual element selection and context extraction.

### Description
React Grab is a developer tool that enables AI coding assistants like Cursor and Claude Code to interact with elements in your React application. By default, coding agents cannot access elements on your page. React Grab solves this problem by allowing developers to point and click to provide context.

The tool works by pressing Command + C, hovering over the desired element, and clicking. It copies the element context (HTML trace) to your clipboard, which can then be provided to AI assistants. Installation is simple - just add a small script tag to your app layout. It supports Next.js App Router, Pages Router, and Vite.

React Grab is compatible with popular AI coding tools such as Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenCode, empowering developers to access, grab, and modify elements dynamically with AI assistance.
