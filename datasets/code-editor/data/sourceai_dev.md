# SourceAI - https://sourceai.dev
[ An AI-powered web code generator that converts natural language prompts into working code across many programming languages ]

## General Info

### Classification
- Code/Editor

### Version
- Unknown (last checked 2026-01-30)
  - No public version number documented; web-based SaaS with no published release cadence

### Repo
- None (proprietary SaaS; no public repository)

### Rating
- [2] Simple natural-language-to-code web generator; limited scope and no IDE integration
- [1] Sparse documentation, unclear pricing, and no visible 2025-2026 feature updates

### Short Description
AI web code generator that converts plain-language prompts into runnable code across many programming languages via a simple web UI; proprietary SaaS focused on fast, one-click code generation.

-

### Description
SourceAI is a web-based AI code generation tool that accepts natural language requests and returns generated code snippets across many programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.). The service advertises a simple, one-click interface targeted at making code generation accessible to both developers and non-developers. It uses large language models to interpret user intent and produce runnable code examples.

### Languages
- Any

### Notes
- Core positioning: simplicity and speed — focused on quick, natural-language-to-code generation rather than deep IDE integrations or collaboration features.
- Technology: public-facing site indicates use of large language models (public references list GPT-3 / Codex as underlying tech in marketing/third-party summaries).
- Limitations: public documentation is sparse. There is no clear information on pricing, enterprise features, private model keys (BYOK), repository or IDE integrations, or offline/local deployment options.
- Example (from site marketing): Python factorial generator for a user-input number (simple, illustrative use case).
- 2025-2026 status: No significant public feature updates or product announcements identified. The product appears relatively static compared to the rapidly evolving AI code assistant market. Limited community presence and documentation updates.
