## Description
SourceAI is a web-based AI code generation tool that accepts natural language requests and returns generated code snippets across many programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.). The service advertises a simple, one-click interface targeted at making code generation accessible to both developers and non-developers. It uses large language models to interpret user intent and produce runnable code examples.

## Notes
- Core positioning: simplicity and speed â€” focused on quick, natural-language-to-code generation rather than deep IDE integrations or collaboration features.
- Technology: public-facing site indicates use of large language models (public references list GPT-3 / Codex as underlying tech in marketing/third-party summaries).
- Limitations: public documentation is sparse. There is no clear information on pricing, enterprise features, private model keys (BYOK), repository or IDE integrations, or offline/local deployment options.
- Example (from site marketing): Python factorial generator for a user-input number (simple, illustrative use case).

## ContextManagement
- No
  - Public-facing documentation and the product site do not describe any structured context management APIs or persistent session/context update mechanisms (no docs found indicating context windows, memory, or programmatic context updates).

## DirectFileReferences
- No
  - There is no public documentation indicating the ability to reference or mount repository files, upload project directories, or directly point the assistant at files in a codebase.

## Hooks
- No
  - No evidence in public docs of lifecycle hooks or event callbacks that external systems can attach to.

## SlashCommands
- No
  - The product appears to be a web UI code generator; there is no documentation of reusable slash-style commands or command registries exposed to users.

## Subagents
- No
  - No documentation or feature descriptions indicate support for defining or orchestrating specialized subagents for task-specific workflows.

## CustomModes
- No
  - No public information about creating specialist operational modes or presets beyond simple prompt templates or language selection.

## Plugins
- No
  - There is no documented plugin system, extension marketplace, or bundling mechanism for adding new capabilities to the service.

## Checkpoints
- No
  - No documented support for checkpoints, snapshot/undo features, or versioned state management for generated outputs.

## SpecDrivenDevelopment
- Other
  - No public evidence that SourceAI integrates with or promotes any formal spec-driven development frameworks (Tessl, SpecKit, OpenSpec, etc.). The product is positioned as a quick natural-language-to-code generator rather than a spec-driven development platform.
