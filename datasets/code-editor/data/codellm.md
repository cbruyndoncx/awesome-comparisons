### Description
CodeLLM is a revolutionary AI code editor by Abacus.AI that helps developers 10x their productivity through smart completion, refactoring, and multi-LLM support. The platform intelligently routes tasks to the best available LLM—whether debugging, generating boilerplate, or optimizing performance—choosing between Claude, Qwen, Gemini 2.5, GPT-5 (Pro and Thinking), o3-pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1, and proprietary Dracarys models. Its real-time "code chat" acts as a pair programmer offering context-aware suggestions while you work. Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows (x64, ARM), CodeLLM provides enterprise-grade security with SOC-2 Type-2, HIPAA compliance, encryption, and a commitment to not train on customer data. At $10/month, it's notably cheaper than ChatGPT's $20 monthly fee while including both interfaces.
