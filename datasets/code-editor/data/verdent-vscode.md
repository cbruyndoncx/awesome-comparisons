# Verdent for VS Code

Verdent for VS Code is the Visual Studio Code extension for Verdent AI — an agentic, plan-first coding assistant which orchestrates parallel subagents to design, implement, and verify code changes with built-in git worktree isolation and DiffLens visualizations.

## Classification
- Code/Editor

## Version
- 2025 (initial public/early access)

## Repository
- Proprietary product — no public GitHub repo discovered

## Rating
- [4] Strong plan-first orchestration, parallel subagents, and git worktree isolation
- [3] Early-stage product with commercial/paid tiers

## Languages
- Any

## Extensible
- Yes
  - Verdent offers extension points and a VS Code plugin; specialized subagents (e.g., Researcher, Verifier) execute tasks in parallel and can be customized.

## Description
Verdent is designed around a "Plan First, Verify Early" methodology. The VS Code extension brings Verdent's orchestration and verification features into the editor so developers can:
- Create high-level plans that break tasks into subagents and subtasks
- Run Researcher and Verifier subagents to analyze code, propose changes, and automatically validate outcomes
- Execute agentic tasks that operate in isolated git worktrees to avoid conflicts
- Inspect changes via DiffLens and commit/rollback via integrated Git workflows

The extension is intended to reduce context switching by letting developers remain inside VS Code while Verdent handles routine engineering work.

## Notes
- Key Features: Plan-first task decomposition and agent orchestration, parallel subagents with isolated git worktrees, built-in verifier for automated testing and web interactions, DiffLens for clear visibility into changes, commit/PR creation and rollback support from within the editor, customizable rules and permissions to control agent autonomy.
- Verdent Deck is the desktop counterpart focused on multi-agent orchestration; the VS Code extension brings the same capabilities into the editor.
- Product is commercial with early access and paid tiers; capabilities and pricing should be verified on the vendor site.
