### Version
v1.0 (2025-10-19)

### Repo
-

### Rating
- [4] Strong for solo builders and founders who want to ship quickly
- [3] Opinionated stack limits applicability for teams with existing, different stacks
  - Tradeoff: deep integration and "finish-first" workflow vs flexibility

### Short Description
<!-- ToDo -->

### Description
EasyCode is a local-first AI-powered development environment that emphasizes finishing applications rather than only generating prototypes. It pairs an opinionated full-stack (Next.js + Supabase) with agentic features: project-wide context management, a planning workflow, file-by-file implementation suggestions, an integrated visual/data-flow debugger, and one-click deployment tooling. The product runs primarily on the user machine (local-first), keeping code and data under developer control and reducing cloud-credit surprises.

### Languages
- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Notes
- Target users: non-technical founders, indie hackers, solo developers and consultants who need predictable time-to-product and prefer a guided, integrated workflow.
- Strengths: strong guidance from planning → implementation → debug → deploy, generous local credit model, tight integration for the chosen stack, agentic debugging and human developer credits for blockers.
- Limitations: locked-in stack (Next.js + Supabase), limited team collaboration features compared with cloud IDEs, no public OSS repo or permissive license available as of this note.
- Use-case fit: excellent for new projects or MVPs that can accept the opinionated stack; less suitable for migrating large existing codebases using other technologies.
