## Description
StarCoder is a decoder-only transformer model optimized for programming tasks. The original released model has ~15.5 billion parameters and was trained by the BigCode community on The Stack — a large, permissively-licensed corpus of GitHub code — with heavy filtering and preprocessing. StarCoder offers a long context window (commonly released with an 8k token context), strong multilingual code support, and capabilities for code completion, infilling, translation between languages, and code-aware question answering.

The project emphasizes responsible open-source release practices (dataset opt-outs, PII redaction tools, attribution tracing) and is distributed under an OpenRAIL-style usage license on Hugging Face. The model can be run locally (with appropriate hardware) or served via inference runtimes (transformers, text-generation-inference, Docker containers, or community tools like Ollama).

## BYOK
- Yes

## LocalOffline
- Yes
  - Can be run locally via Hugging Face transformers, text-generation-inference, or containerized inference (GPU recommended). Community runtimes like Ollama/TGI simplify local hosting.

## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Model weights and checkpoints are openly downloadable (subject to accepting the model card / license on Hugging Face).

## GitSupport
- 

## Terminal
- Yes
  - Usable from terminal/CLI via TGI / transformers scripts or Docker images for batch/interactive use.

## Opensource
- Yes

## License
- Other
  - BigCode-OpenRAIL / OpenRAIL-M (model card requires agreement on use)

## MCP-Client

## Notes
- Key strengths: open-source, strong code performance for many languages, long context handling (8k tokens), and community-driven tooling.
- Training data: The Stack (curated permissively-licensed GitHub code); BigCode published data curation and opt-out tooling.
- Privacy & safety: authors provided a PII redaction pipeline and attribution tracing to help source provenance and mitigate leakage risks.
- Variants/evolution: StarCoder followed by StarCoder2 family (further improvements and language coverage in later releases).
- Typical uses: editor completions, code generation from docstrings, refactoring assistance, automated code reviews, and local/offline deployments for privacy-sensitive environments.
- Limitations: may reproduce licensed or low-quality snippets from training data; users should validate generated code for correctness, security, and licensing implications.
- Integration tips: use temperature/top-p tuning for generation quality, provide clear prompts (function signatures, tests) for best results, and prefer fp16/bf16 runtime on GPU for performance.
