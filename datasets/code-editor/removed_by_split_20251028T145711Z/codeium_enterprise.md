## Notes
- Deployments: Offers SaaS, self-hosted VPC, and fully air-gapped on-premises deployment models to meet strict data-sovereignty and compliance needs. Typical enterprise installations use containerized deployments (Helm/Kubernetes or Docker Compose) and can be run on infrastructure with GPU acceleration where required.
- Security: Enterprise features include end-to-end encryption, indexing access controls, audit logging, and administrative analytics. Air-gapped deployments ensure no code or telemetry leaves the customer environment.
- Platform & infra: Enterprise installs may require NVIDIA drivers and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit for GPU-accelerated deployments and access to enterprise container images (licensed by Codeium).
- Features: Personalization/finetuning on private codebases, subteam analytics, audit trails, priority enterprise support (dedicated Slack channels / support portal), and one-click installers for simplified deployment.
- Impact: Vendor materials and case studies report developer productivity gains (reduced PR cycle time, faster debugging and testing) when teams adopt the enterprise product.
- Gaps / vendor follow-up: Public-facing documentation does not clearly document Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) key management options or the exact key management integration workflow. Organizations with strict KMS/BYOK requirements should request detailed security architecture and KMS integration docs from Codeium sales/enterprise support.
