### Short Description
- AI assistant that automates developer tasks by reading codebases, understanding tickets, planning edits, and generating pull requests directly on GitHub without requiring an IDE.

### Description
Sweep is an intelligent open-source AI assistant that automates typical developer tasks by transforming bug reports and feature requests into code changes. Unlike Copilot's line-by-line suggestions, Sweep handles end-to-end workflows: given a GitHub issue (marked with "Sweep:"), the agent plans how to solve it, writes the necessary code, and turns the issue directly into a pull request without requiring an IDE. The system supports follow-up actions from issue comments, enabling iterative refinement. Originally built to work via GitHub issues and PRs, Sweep also integrates as a plugin for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand), delivering AI-driven code modifications, inline completions, test generation, and static-analysis feedback. With over 5,000 GitHub stars and handling approximately 100 pull requests daily, Sweep is particularly effective for routine maintenance work, bug fixes, and small feature implementations.
