# Manus AI - https://manus.im/

World's first fully autonomous AI agent from Chinese startup Monica.im. Launched March 2025, achieving 86.5% accuracy and outperforming OpenAI's Deep Research in GAIA benchmarks with 100+ independent AI agents.

## General Info

### Classification
- Code/Autonomous agent

### Version
- 1.6 (2025-2026; Manus Max variant added)

### Repo
- N/A
  - Proprietary model; no public repository found.

### Rating
- [4] First fully autonomous AI agent with strong GAIA benchmark results (86.5% accuracy)
- [4] Asynchronous cloud-based operation with multi-agent architecture (100+ sub-agents)

### Short Description
- Fully autonomous AI agent with sandboxed execution environment featuring browser, Python interpreter, file system, and terminal access for independent task planning and execution without human supervision.

### Description
Manus AI is recognized as the world's first fully autonomous AI agent, developed by Chinese startup Monica.im and launched around March 2025. Unlike conventional AI chatbots that rely on human prompts, Manus AI integrates multiple AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen) to analyze, plan, and execute workflows autonomously. Each user session runs in a secure sandboxed environment with a full web browser, Python interpreter, file system, and terminal access, allowing Manus to not only generate text and code but also execute code, browse websites, interact with files, and even deploy results to the web—all autonomously. The system comprises over 100 independent AI agents working together. In testing on eight real-world coding jobs, it achieved 86.5% accuracy, outpacing other AI models at approximately 67.9%, and surpassed OpenAI's Deep Research agent in GAIA benchmarks. Currently accessible via invitation-only beta.

### Languages
- Any

### Notes
- Fully autonomous: Independently thinks, plans, and executes complex tasks without human supervision.
- 100+ AI agents: System of over 100 independent AI agents working in concert.
- Sandboxed execution: Full browser, Python interpreter, file system, and terminal in secure environment.
- Superior performance: 86.5% accuracy vs ~67.9% for other models; beats OpenAI Deep Research in GAIA.
- Real-world coding: Tested on Python scripts, debugging, algorithm explanations, HTML/React/games.
- Speed and accuracy: Stands out for both rapid execution and clear explanations.
- Autonomous deployment: Can execute code, browse web, interact with files, and deploy to production.
- Claude + Qwen powered: Uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Alibaba's Qwen models.
- Monica.im: Developed by Chinese AI startup specializing in autonomous agents.
- Invitation-only beta: Currently requires waitlist approval with use case description.
- Launched March 2025 with strong benchmark results.
- 2025-2026 Update: Manus 1.6 released with Manus Max (more powerful agent variant), mobile development support (beyond web apps), Design View for interactive image creation, and enhanced UI aesthetics. Asynchronous cloud operation allows users to disconnect while tasks complete in background. Memory and adaptive learning added (retains user preferences across sessions). CEO announced plans to release agentic foundation models under open-source license. Platform expanded beyond coding to serve business analysts, researchers, marketers, and customer service teams. Still invitation-only beta access.
