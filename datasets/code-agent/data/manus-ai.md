### Short Description
- Fully autonomous AI agent with sandboxed execution environment featuring browser, Python interpreter, file system, and terminal access for independent task planning and execution without human supervision.

### Description
Manus AI is recognized as the world's first fully autonomous AI agent, developed by Chinese startup Monica.im and launched around March 2025. Unlike conventional AI chatbots that rely on human prompts, Manus AI integrates multiple AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen) to analyze, plan, and execute workflows autonomously. Each user session runs in a secure sandboxed environment with a full web browser, Python interpreter, file system, and terminal access, allowing Manus to not only generate text and code but also execute code, browse websites, interact with files, and even deploy results to the web—all autonomously. The system comprises over 100 independent AI agents working together. In testing on eight real-world coding jobs, it achieved 86.5% accuracy, outpacing other AI models at approximately 67.9%, and surpassed OpenAI's Deep Research agent in GAIA benchmarks. Currently accessible via invitation-only beta.
