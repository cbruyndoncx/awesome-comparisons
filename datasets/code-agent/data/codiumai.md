### Description
CodiumAI (rebranded to Qodo) is an AI-first code quality platform focused on automated test generation, behavior coverage analysis, and AI-assisted pull request review. Rather than being a generic code completion assistant, its core capabilities generate meaningful unit and integration tests, map component behaviors to measure coverage, and provide actionable PR feedback. The company offers IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains family), a CLI/CI-friendly PR agent that can run in CI or self-hosted environments, and a suite of agentic features for automating QA workflows.

### Languages
- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript

### Notes
- Rebranded to Qodo in 2024; platform and docs may be under either the Codium AI or Qodo name.
- Strong fit for teams that need better automated test coverage and PR-level code quality checks rather than just inline code completion.
- Provides behavior-coverage driven test generation which aims to produce diverse, behavior-focused tests instead of simple smoke tests.
- Offers IDE integrations, CI/CLI tools, and an open-source PR-Agent for self-hosting/CI use-cases.
- Enterprise offerings include additional controls and integrations; advanced models (including GPT-4) may be available on paid tiers.
