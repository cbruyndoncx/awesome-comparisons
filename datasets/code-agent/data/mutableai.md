### Description
MutableAI (mutable.ai) is an AI-first developer productivity platform focused on code understanding, documentation, and automated code transformations. Its core capabilities include automatically generating a living wiki for a codebase (with citations to specific files/lines), conversational codebase search/chat, generated architecture diagrams, and one-click refactors/transformations to improve readability, add types, or move prototypes toward production. The product emphasizes keeping docs in sync with code by updating documentation on code changes and offering editable AI-generated articles.

The platform is positioned for both individual developer workflows (autocomplete, assistant-like edits) and team/enterprise use (onboarding, knowledge transfer, auditability, and on-premises/enterprise deployment options).

### Languages
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python
- Go
