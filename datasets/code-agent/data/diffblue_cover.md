### Description
Diffblue Cover is a commercial AI-driven product that automatically generates and maintains unit tests for Java code. It integrates into developer workflows (IntelliJ plugin for inner-loop use) and into CI/CD pipelines (CLI, CI plugins) for broader, project-level test generation. Cover uses ML techniques to produce compilable, runnable JUnit/TestNG tests to increase coverage, reduce manual test-writing toil, and help with regression testing and refactoring safety.

### Languages
- Java

### Notes
- Editions: Community (free, limited Methods Under Test), Developer (paid tiers with higher MUT quotas), Teams and Enterprise (larger-scale, CLI/CI integration, analytics/dashboard and on-prem/enterprise deployment options).
- Integrations: IntelliJ plugin, GitHub/GitLab, Jenkins and other CI systems, Docker and common Java build ecosystems (Maven/Gradle/Spring).
- Pricing model: free community tier with monthly MUT limits; developer subscriptions with fixed MUT bundles; Teams/Enterprise with capacity- and user-based pricing and bespoke contracts.
- Use-cases: fast inner-loop test creation for developers, bulk test generation for legacy codebases, regression testing and coverage improvements, test maintenance during refactors.
- Unknown / not publicly documented here: explicit BYOK/key-management details, detailed on-prem installation steps and specific license terms—contact Diffblue sales for enterprise security, on-prem deployment and licensing specifics.
