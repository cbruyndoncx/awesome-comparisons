## Porter's Five Forces

### SupplierPower
- Medium
  - Custom silicon reliance is limited but hardware vendors for Exadata/AMD still hold some leverage

### BuyerPower
- High
  - Customers often negotiate enterprise license agreements covering DB + cloud credits, exerting pricing pressure

### NewEntrants
- Low
  - Infrastructure build-out plus compliance for dual regions create barriers to entry

### Substitutes
- Medium
  - Competing managed databases and SaaS suites can replace Oracle workloads if migration incentives align

### Rivalry
- High
  - Battles hyperscalers plus SAP/Workday in apps, leading to bundled incentives and marketing wars

## BCG Portfolio

  - OCI grows faster than legacy Oracle but overall market share expansion remains gradual

### RelativeMarketShare
- Low
  - OCI trails hyperscalers significantly, though capturing specific regulated workloads

### BCGQuadrant
- Question Mark
  - Competes in high-growth market but share remains low, demanding continued investment

## Gartner MQ

### AbilityToExecute
