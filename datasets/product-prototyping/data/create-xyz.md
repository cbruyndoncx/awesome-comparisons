- AI-powered generative app builder that converts natural language descriptions into production-ready web and mobile applications with complete backend infrastructure.

### Description
Create.xyz (rebranded as Anything) is a generative AI app builder that enables users to describe applications in plain English and receive fully functional web and mobile apps with frontend, backend, databases, authentication, and integrations. Unlike traditional drag-and-drop no-code builders, the platform generates actual production-ready code that can be viewed, edited, and exported. It integrates with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 50+ third-party services including Stripe, Stable Diffusion, ElevenLabs, and Google Maps. The conversational interface supports iterative refinement where users describe changes and see results rendered in real time.

### Languages
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS

### Notes

- Real code output: Generates actual production-ready code, not proprietary visual blocks, reducing vendor lock-in.
- AI model integration: Built-in access to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI-powered features within generated apps.
- 50+ third-party integrations: Stripe, OpenAI, Google Maps, Stable Diffusion, ElevenLabs, and more.
- Building blocks: Frontend pages, reusable UI components, backend functions, database setup, user authentication, and asset management.
- Iterative refinement: Select specific sections and request targeted modifications through conversation.
- Code export: Generated code can be exported for integration into other applications and environments.
- Live deployment: One-click deployment for public or internal use.
- Team collaboration: Multiple team members can contribute to the AI-building process.
