### Description
CodeWP is a commercial AI code-generation tool tailored to WordPress development. It accepts natural-language prompts and returns ready-to-use WordPress code: functions, shortcodes, theme snippets, REST endpoints, block code, and can package snippets as plugins for easier deployment. The product emphasizes WordPress-specific compatibility by providing "modes" trained or tuned for common plugins and builders (ACF, Elementor, WooCommerce, Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7, MemberPress, Easy Digital Downloads, etc.). It also includes a searchable snippets library and a 24/7 chat assistant for guidance.

### Languages

### Notes
- Pricing tiers (public info at time of research):
  - Free / Starter: limited monthly actions (about 100), 1 project, community support
  - Pro: ~$28/month — larger action quota (~10k/mo), multiple projects
  - Agency: ~$68/month — unlimited actions, unlimited projects, team features
- Key strengths:
  - WordPress-focused outputs that save time for common WP tasks
  - Specialized modes for major plugins and page builders help generate compatible code
  - Ability to export generated snippets as a plugin simplifies deployment
  - Large searchable snippets library and tutorials at https://codewp.ai/snippets/
- Considerations:
  - Not open source — code generation is a hosted service
  - Limited built-in Git or terminal integration; workflow expects copying generated code into your WP projects or using the plugin export
  - Review generated code and test in staging — as with all AI-generated code, manual review is recommended for security and compatibility
