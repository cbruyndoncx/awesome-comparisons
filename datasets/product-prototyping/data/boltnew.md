# Bolt.new - https://bolt.new/
Bolt.new is a browser-first, AI-powered full-stack development environment that lets you scaffold, run, edit, and deploy applications entirely from the web.

## Version
N/A (2025-10-19)

## Rating
- [4] Excellent for rapid full‑stack prototyping and demos
- [3] Limited offline / local-only workflows

## Repository
- N/A

## Languages
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- (Limited) Python

## Extensible
- Yes
  - Supports npm packages and integrations (can install libraries and use third-party APIs)

## Description
Bolt.new (by StackBlitz) combines an in‑browser IDE powered by WebContainers with an AI assistant that can generate full‑stack applications from natural language prompts. It runs Node.js in the browser, provides an interactive terminal, automatic package management, and tools for debugging, database wiring, and one‑click deployment. The AI assistant can scaffold frontends (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.), create backend routes, configure databases, and help fix runtime errors — all without requiring local environment setup.

## BYOK
- No

## LocalOffline
- No
  - Any additional details: Runs entirely in the browser using WebContainers; requires network access for AI features and many integrations.

## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Public/free tier available with usage limits; paid plans for advanced features may exist.

## GitSupport
- Yes
  - Import/export with GitHub and connect projects to repos for persistence and collaboration.

## Terminal
- Yes
  - In‑browser terminal via WebContainers that can run npm, Node.js servers, and CLI tooling.

## Opensource
- No

## License
- Proprietary

## MCP-Client
- No

## Notes
- Built on StackBlitz WebContainers tech to run a real Node.js environment fully in the browser.
- AI can generate both frontend and backend code, wire databases (examples: Supabase), and deploy to platforms like Netlify/Cloudflare with minimal friction.
- Great fit for prototyping, demos, learning, and quick experiments where zero local setup is a priority.
- Not designed for fully offline/local development or for bringing your own model; it is a cloud/browser service with proprietary components.
- Good integration for teams wanting fast iteration cycles, but teams that require self‑hosted or open‑source tooling may find limitations.
