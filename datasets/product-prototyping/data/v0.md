## General Info

### Classification

  - Continuously updated SaaS product; no version numbers published

### Repo

### Rating
- [4] Usability: polished chat-based UX that designers and devs can use quickly
- [4] Output quality: generates usable React + Tailwind (shadcn/ui) code but requires manual review for complex cases

### Short Description
- AI-first design-to-code platform from Vercel that turns natural-language prompts and Figma designs into editable, deployable React + Tailwind (shadcn/ui) components and small Next.js applications

-

### Description
v0 is an AI-first UI builder from Vercel that transforms natural-language prompts or Figma designs into working frontend components and small applications. It focuses on generating React components styled with Tailwind CSS (often using shadcn/ui patterns), provides an iterative chat interface for refinement, and integrates with Vercel deployment workflows. The product is aimed at speeding up prototyping and UI development while keeping outputs usable in real projects.

### Languages
- TypeScript
- JavaScript 
  - React
- HTML/CSS 
  - Tailwind

### Notes
- Core strengths:
  - Fast design-to-code: accepts plain-English prompts or Figma uploads and returns React + Tailwind code
  - Iterative chat UX: keep context within a project chat to refine components and ask for fixes or new variants
  - Integration-ready: designed to fit into Vercel-hosted Next.js/React flows and can push code to GitHub for automatic deployments
  - Platform/API: offers a platform/API for building custom AI-assisted app builders or automations

- Typical outputs:
  - Component files (React + Tailwind), layout scaffolding, and style variants
  - Workable but often requires manual tuning for accessibility, edge-case logic, or complex interactions

- Pricing (subject to change):
  - Freemium tier exists for trial and light usage
  - Paid tiers provide larger "credits" allocation for higher-volume generation and team/enterprise features (team seats, SSO, audit logs, SLAs)
  - Exact pricing and credit rules change over time—check https://v0.dev or https://v0.app/pricing for the current plans

- Limitations and considerations:
  - Best for frontend UI generation and prototyping; not a full backend builder
  - Generated code should be reviewed for accessibility, security, and performance before shipping
  - Quality depends on prompt clarity; more detailed prompts yield better results

- Suggested workflow:
  - 1. Start a new v0 project/chat and describe the UI or upload a Figma frame
  - 2. Accept an initial draft, then iterate via chat commands (colors, spacing, interactions)
  - 3. Connect GitHub/Vercel to push generated code into a repo and enable preview deployments
  - 4. Review and refactor generated code as part of the normal code-review process

### Last Update
- 2025-11-15

## Licensing

### Opensource
- No
  - The v0 product and its generation backend are proprietary; generated code is standard open-stack (React/Tailwind) that you can use in your own repos

### License
- Proprietary

### FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Freemium model / free tier available for evaluation

## MCP-Client

### MCP-Client
- No
  - v0 exposes a platform/API for programmatic generation and repository integrations, but it does not ship a public "MCP client" component for connecting to external MCP servers

### Prompts
- Yes
  - Natural-language prompts are the primary interaction model; users can describe UIs, request variants, and iterate via chat

### Tools
- Yes
  - v0 provides built-in tooling in the chat UI (code preview, "open in v0" for components, deployment links) and a Platform API for programmatic workflows

### Resources
- Yes
  - Supports attaching files, including repository context and shadcn component registry references; can import design assets (Figma screenshots/uploads) via the UI or API

## Deployment

### BYOK
- No
  - v0 uses Vercel's cloud-based models and inference; there is no documented workflow to supply your own LLM API key to v0's hosted service

### LocalOffline
- No
  - v0 is a cloud service (web app and API). It does not run fully offline; model execution and generation happen on Vercel's servers.

## Developer Experience

### ContextManagement
- Yes
  - Project-scoped chat preserves context, previous messages, uploads and project files to inform subsequent generations and iterative edits

### DirectFileReferences
- Yes
  - Platform/API accepts repository context and file attachments; users can include source files or link repos to provide grounding

### Checkpoints
- Yes
  - Chat history, forking of chats, and integration with GitHub/Vercel (commits / preview deployments) provide practical checkpoints and revision history

### GitSupport
- Yes
  - Integrates with GitHub and Vercel deployments for pushing generated projects and previewing sites

## Extensible

### Extensible
- Yes
  - Platform API and integrations allow automation, custom workflows and embedding v0 generation into larger CI/CD or tooling pipelines

### Plugins
- No
  - No public plugin marketplace; integrations are provided via the Platform API and direct integrations rather than a user-facing plugin bundling system

### Hooks
- No
  - While integrations and deployment webhooks are available via Vercel/GitHub, v0 does not document a public lifecycle hook system for agent internals

### SlashCommands
- No
  - The chat interface is driven by natural language prompts and UI actions rather than documented slash-command primitives

### CustomModes
- Yes
  - v0 supports different generation modes and templates (component-focused, app scaffolding, design-to-code) and offers agentic workflows for multi-step tasks

### Subagents
- Yes
  - Agentic features in v0.app enable task planning, automated checks, and programmatic workflows that act like specialized subagents for certain tasks

## Ungrouped Criteria

### Terminal
- No
  - Primary interface is web chat; platform/API can be integrated programmatically but there is no primary local CLI for generation

### SpecDrivenDevelopment
- No
  - v0 is a design-to-code generation tool, not a spec-driven development framework
