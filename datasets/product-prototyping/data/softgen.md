### Description
Softgen is an AI-powered web app builder that generates complete full-stack applications from plain English descriptions. It uses a conversational scaffolding approach through its AI agent called "Cascade" which engages in dialogue to clarify project goals, formulate development plans, and generate production-grade code using React, Next.js v15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The platform integrates Supabase for databases, Firebase for authentication, Stripe and LemonSqueezy for payments, and Resend for email services. All generated code is exported to private GitHub repositories with 100% ownership, eliminating vendor lock-in. Users can build MVPs in hours and iterate through chat-based refinement.
