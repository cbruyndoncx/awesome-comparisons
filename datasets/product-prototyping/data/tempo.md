### Short Description
- AI-powered design-to-code platform that enables developers, designers, and product managers to build React applications 10x faster through visual editing combined with AI code generation.

### Description
Tempo is a 2025-era AI development platform accessible at tempo.new that bridges the gap between design and development. It features a planning-first AI engine that generates Product Requirements Documents and user flow diagrams before writing code, a Figma-like visual editor for React components with Tailwind CSS properties panel, and seamless integration with GitHub and GitLab for version control. The platform supports importing existing component libraries from Storybook and integrates with third-party APIs through its MCP App Store (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Firecrawl). Tempo targets full-stack collaborative workflows where designers, developers, and product managers contribute to the same live codebase.

### Languages
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- React/JSX

### Notes
- Planning-first approach: Generates PRDs and user flow diagrams before code generation, improving architecture for complex applications.
- Visual-code duality: Drag-and-drop React editor with Figma-like styling panel plus direct VSCode integration for granular control.
- Storybook import: Can import existing component libraries to build on established design systems.
- MCP App Store: Streamlined integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, Firecrawl, Stripe, and other APIs.
- Mobile development supported through Expo integration for React Native apps.
- Claude 4 and Gemini Search integrated for advanced AI reasoning and code generation.
- GitHub and GitLab version control with branch management and team collaboration.
- Chorus AI case study: Reduced front-end development costs by 50% and increased velocity by 3x.
- Three user personas: Developers (accelerate UI dev), Designers (visual React editing), Product Managers (rapid prototyping and PRD generation).
