In direct comparison against Claude Sonnet 4.5, Composer 1 produces comparable or slightly superior coding quality while using less than half the tokens (200K vs 427K) and significantly less time. The model was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases, with access to production-grade tools including codebase-wide semantic search, code editing capabilities, string grepping functionality, and terminal command execution. To scale this training approach, Cursor implemented hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud, adapting infrastructure originally built for Background Agents and rewriting their virtual machine scheduler to handle high-volume, bursty training runs. Composer 1 is available exclusively within Cursor 2.0 and Cursor's CLI with no direct API access to external users, priced at the same level as GPT-5. The model demonstrates particular strength in multi-step coding tasks, large codebase navigation, and low-latency agent-based coding workflows.

The model uses a layerwise hybrid structure that strategically combines Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) with Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) layers in a 3:1 ratio, balancing computational efficiency with global information processing capabilities. KDA extends the Gated DeltaNet framework with a finer-grained, channel-wise gating mechanism that allows independent control over memory decay rates across individual feature dimensions, using specialized Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices optimized through a bespoke chunkwise algorithm that delivers approximately 100% improvement in operator efficiency and nearly 2x kernel speedup for sequence lengths up to 64K. This eliminates three matrix multiplications per chunk while remaining consistent with the classical delta rule. Kimi Linear reduces KV cache requirements by up to 75% during inference, enabling processing of batches up to 4 times larger on the same GPU hardware or deployment on cheaper infrastructure. The model achieves up to 6x faster decoding throughput at 1 million token contexts compared to full MLA baselines—specifically 1.84 milliseconds per output token versus 11.48 milliseconds for the MLA baseline at precisely 1 million tokens, transforming ultra-long context processing from offline-only speeds to potentially interactive performance levels. Supporting a 1,048,576 token context window and released under MIT license, Kimi Linear demonstrates superior performance across short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning scaling regimes, with particularly strong results on RULER benchmark (84.3 vs 81.3 for MLA baseline) and Repo QA tasks."}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Languages","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Any","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Notes","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Hybrid architecture: 3:1 ratio of Kimi Delta Attention to Multi-Head Latent Attention layers.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Kimi Delta Attention: Finer-grained channel-wise gating for independent memory decay control.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"100% operator efficiency: Specialized DPLR transition matrices with bespoke chunkwise algorithm.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"2x kernel speedup: Nearly 2x faster for sequence lengths up to 64K tokens.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"75% KV cache reduction: Enables 4x larger batches on same hardware or cheaper deployment.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"6x faster decoding: At 1M token contexts vs full MLA baseline (1.84ms vs 11.48ms per token).","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"1M token context: Supports 1,048,576 token context window.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Interactive ultra-long context: Transforms offline-only speeds to interactive performance.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Superior benchmarks: Outperforms full MLA across all evaluation scenarios with identical training.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"RULER excellence: 84.3 vs 81.3 for MLA baseline on long-range retrieval tasks.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Drop-in replacement: Functions as direct replacement for traditional full attention architectures.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"No positional encoding: MLA layers use no positional encoding; KDA handles implicit positioning.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Eliminates matrix operations: Removes three matrix multiplications per chunk.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"48B total / 3B active: Mixture of Experts architecture with efficient parameter usage.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"MIT licensed: Open-source with KDA kernel and vLLM implementations available.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Pre-trained checkpoints: Both pre-trained and instruction-tuned models released.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Code repository QA: Strong performance on finding information in large code repositories.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"RL scaling: Particularly effective for reinforcement learning with longer sequences.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Cost-sensitive deployment: Optimized for hardware efficiency and cost reduction.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Released October 31 - November 1, 2025 as efficiency-focused alternative to K2.","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Moonshot AI: From Alibaba-backed Beijing startup known for long-context innovations.","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Last Update","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"2026-02-06","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Licensing","children":[]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Opensource","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Yes","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"License","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"MIT","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Free Trial","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Yes","plainChildren":""}]}]}],"sourcePath":"datasets/aie-model/data/kimi-linear.md"},{"type":"header","level":1,"content":"Kite — - https://kite.com","children":[{"type":"text","content":"A desktop AI code-completion assistant focused initially on Python, later multi-language.

Unlike general-purpose AI coding tools that struggle with Delphi's unique architecture, CodeBot natively understands the relationship between Object Pascal source files (.pas) and visual form definition files (.dfm), making it the first AI tool capable of properly reasoning about Delphi's component-based development model.\n\nCodeBot functions as an \"agentic system\" that can reason about tasks, plan multi-step solutions, and execute coordinated changes across multiple files in a project. It leverages state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5/4) enhanced with a proprietary \"Delphi Filter\" that ensures generated code follows Object Pascal idioms and Delphi architectural patterns. The tool operates in two primary modes: \"Vibe It\" mode for rapid snippet generation and prototyping, and \"Thorough\" mode which applies SOLID principles, interfaces, dependency injection, and ensures code is unit-testable.\n\nCodeBot addresses the \"Cursor problem\"—standard AI coding tools fail with Delphi because they cannot comprehend the intricate relationships between visual components, events, properties, and the underlying Object Pascal code. By understanding this architecture, CodeBot can perform tasks like adding UI components with proper event wiring, converting legacy VCL Windows applications to cross-platform FireMonkey (FMX) apps, translating code from other languages (Python, C#) into idiomatic Object Pascal, and generating complete REST API client units with JSON serialization.\n\nThe tool integrates directly into the Delphi IDE as a native plugin, providing conversational AI assistance, smart code completion, refactoring features, and project-wide code analysis. CodeBot also bridges compatibility between Embarcadero's compiler and RemObjects Elements, ensuring binary compatibility across Windows, Linux, WebAssembly, and other

Users can iterate on designs through a chat interface, switch to dev mode for direct code editing, or use direct edit mode for text changes without consuming credits."}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Languages","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"TypeScript","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"JavaScript","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"React framework for frontend","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Hono framework for API endpoints","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"HTML/CSS","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Generated as part of React components","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"SQL","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"SQLite database","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":2,"content":"Notes","children":[{"type":"list","level":2,"children":[{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Core strengths:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Vibe coding: Describe desired app functionality with words or images and iterate through conversational interface","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"True all-in-one stack: Backend, database, authentication, payments, hosting with zero configuration","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Code ownership: Export complete project code at any time with full freedom to modify and deploy elsewhere","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Opinionated tech stack: TypeScript + React + Hono + SQLite eliminates decision paralysis","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Cloudflare deployment: Automatic hosting and deployment with custom domain support","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Developer features:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Dev Mode: View and edit code directly with real-time preview updates","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Direct Edit Mode: Click-to-edit text without consuming credits","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Discuss Mode: Conversational planning and debugging assistance","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"API integration: Connect external backends by providing API keys","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Pricing (2025-2026):","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Starter: Free with 120 credits, deploy 1 app","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Bronze: $20/month for 1,500 credits, publish up to 5 apps, custom domains","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Silver: $50/month for 4,500 credits, publish up to 15 apps, priority support","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Gold: $200/month for 20,000 credits, publish up to 25 apps, early access to new features","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"All paid plans support custom domains and watermark removal","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Limitations and considerations:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"No custom tech stacks: Cannot bring your own frameworks or libraries","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"No external deployment: Must use Cloudflare hosting (though code can be exported)","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"No Figma import: Screenshots and descriptions serve as alternatives","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"App complexity limits vary by subscription tier","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Generated code should be reviewed for accessibility, security, and edge-case handling","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"Typical workflow:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":1,"content":"1.

Grok CLI can handle up to 400 tool execution rounds by default to manage sophisticated workflows, and it supports OpenAI-compatible APIs allowing integration with multiple model providers (X.AI, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq).\n\nBuilt with TypeScript and the Ink framework (React-based terminal UI), Grok CLI runs on Bun 1.0+ (with Node.js 18+ fallback) and offers both interactive and headless modes. The interactive mode provides a real-time conversational interface, while headless mode enables single-prompt execution suitable for scripting and CI/CD pipelines.
