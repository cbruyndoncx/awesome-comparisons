## Notes
- Key features:
  - PR summaries and guided walkthroughs of changes
  - Automated security & quality analysis via many linters and scanners
  - Code graph / AST analysis to understand cross-file impacts
  - IDE extensions to bring reviews earlier into the developer workflow
  - Integrations with issue trackers and chat (Jira, Linear, Slack)
- Security / privacy:
  - Claims SOC2 Type II compliance, ephemeral review environments, end-to-end encryption, and zero data retention after analysis
  - Uses isolated execution (Google Cloud Run referenced in architecture notes) to reduce risk from analyzing untrusted code
- Deployment:
  - Primary offering is SaaS. Vendor materials mention a self-hosted option for enterprises but public details (architecture, BYOK, on-prem instructions, air-gapped support) are limitedâ€”contact vendor for enterprise requirements.
