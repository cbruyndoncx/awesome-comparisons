benchmark.":{},"Provides cross-language code translation and multilingual code generation capabilities; reported strong performance compared to contemporaneous open models.":{},"IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains) exist to make the model usable as a coding assistant; downstream usage may be subject to the model weights' licensing terms.":{},"For commercial deployment, review the repository's instructions and registration process for obtaining the model weights.":{},"See also: CodeGeeX2 (follow-up) and related THUDM releases which may have differing licenses or access requirements.":{},"https://codeium.com/":{},"https://codeium.com/enterprise (vendor enterprise overview)":{},"Variants: Code Llama-Instruct (better at following natural-language prompts) and Code Llama-Python (additional Python fine-tuning).":{},"Sizes: commonly available in 7B, 13B, 34B; larger checkpoints and tuned variants exist depending on releases.":{},"Context window: the official models are released with substantially larger context windows (commonly 16k tokens for code-focused variants); deployment runtimes and custom forks may offer extended context support.":{},"Deployment: Widely available through Hugging Face, community containers, and local runtimes (Ollama, private inference servers).":{},"Strengths: open-source, good quality for code tasks, multiple sizes for trade-offs between latency and capability.":{},"Limitations: still requires careful prompt engineering for complex multi-file project reasoning; ecosystem tooling (IDE/product integrations) is smaller than some commercial competitors but growing quickly.":{},"Model support: commonly used with Salesforce CodeGen models converted for FasterTransformer / Triton; models are typically downloaded from Hugging Face and converted during setup.":{},"Hardware: requires an NVIDIA GPU (compute capability >= 6.0) and sufficient VRAM for the chosen model. VRAM can be aggregated across multiple GPUs for larger models.":{},"Installation: requires Docker, docker-compose (>= 1.28), nvidia-docker (nvidia-container-toolkit), curl and zstd for model download/extraction. A setup script helps choose and prepare a model.":{},"Integrations: offers OpenAI API compatibility, REST endpoints, and Copilot-plugin style integrations so it can be used with existing editor tooling.":{},"Privacy: primary selling point is that all inference can be run locally so developer code does not leave the network and no external telemetry is required.":{},"Support: community-driven project; documentation is community-maintained (wiki, discussion forum). There is no formal commercial support or warranty.":{},"Common pitfalls: accurate VRAM estimation is critical; ensure nvidia-docker and drivers are correctly installed and that the chosen model fits available GPU memory (or configure model sharding across GPUs).":{},"Founded 2014; widely adopted by Python developers for smarter completions and docs.":{},"Raised funding and grew to a large community, but announced shutdown in late 2022 due to a combination of technical limits (models not yet delivering transformative improvements) and monetization challenges.":{},"Legacy: influenced expectations for context-aware completions and privacy-conscious local inference; lessons from Kite informed subsequent entrants and enterprise offerings in the AI coding space.":{},"As of 2025 the company is inactive; repositories remain as historical artifacts and starting points for community forks and research.":{},"Trained on ~249GB of code; primary claim-to-fame is strong C-code performance compared to models available in 2022.":{},"Comes in three sizes (160M, 405M, 2.7B) so teams can choose a footprint that matches hardware constraints.":{},"Checkpoints and training/evaluation scripts were published to enable reproducible research; model files were also archived on Zenodo and mirrored to Hugging Face by community contributors.":{},"Requires modern Transformers (4.23+) for out-of-the-box loading; community adapters support LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning and GGUF quantized deployments.":{},"Good choice for on-premise, privacy-sensitive deployments (no external API calls required).":{},"Keep expectations realistic: PolyCoder is a 2022-era model and does not match the capabilities of later multi-hundred-billion-parameter code-specialized models, though it remains valuable for C/C++ and systems-level use-cases.":{},"Key strengths: open-source, strong code performance for many languages, long context handling (8k tokens), and community-driven tooling.":{},"Training data: The Stack (curated permissively-licensed GitHub code); BigCode published data curation and opt-out tooling.":{},"Privacy & safety: authors provided a PII redaction pipeline and attribution tracing to help source provenance and mitigate leakage risks.":{},"Variants/evolution: StarCoder followed by StarCoder2 family (further improvements and language coverage in later releases).":{},"Typical uses: editor completions, code generation from docstrings, refactoring assistance, automated code reviews, and local/offline deployments for privacy-sensitive environments.":{},"Limitations: may reproduce licensed or low-quality snippets from training data; users should validate generated code for correctness, security, and licensing implications.":{},"Integration tips: use temperature/top-p tuning for generation quality, provide clear prompts (function signatures, tests) for best results, and prefer fp16/bf16 runtime on GPU for performance.":{},"Agentic design: Amp works as an autonomous agent that can perform multi-step reasoning, gather context from the repo, and iteratively refine changes.":{},"AGENT.md integration: Amp reads project AGENT.md files to adopt repo-specific conventions and standards, improving alignment with existing codebase patterns.":{},"Extended thinking: Supports adjustable \"thinking budget\" for deeper, higher-quality reasoning on complex tasks.":{},"Thread sharing & collaboration: Conversation threads can be synced and shared to a web console for team collaboration, knowledge sharing, and reproducibility of AI-driven change sequences.":{},"Command allowlisting: Security control that limits which shell/CLI commands the agent may execute, stored with project settings.":{},"Dual environment: Both VS Code extension and CLI are available — the CLI enables parallel, lightweight agent runs; the extension surfaces suggestions inline while preserving developer workflows.":{},"Security & testing: Best used alongside automated security testing (DAST/SAST) to catch vulnerabilities introduced during rapid AI-driven edits.":{},"Use cases: large-scale refactors, implementing cross-cutting features, writing complex algorithms, creating board-level changes spanning multiple files.":{},"Market position: Positioned as a next-generation, high-quality AI coding agent for teams wanting autonomous assistance beyond standard completion tools.":{},"Skills: Claude Desktop leverages the Skills system to encode org-specific procedures and standards. Skills can be created and shared (Team/Enterprise controls apply), and Claude will automatically invoke relevant skills when they match a user's request.":{},"File operations: The app supports creating and editing Excel-like spreadsheets (including formulas), PowerPoint slide decks, Word documents, and fillable PDFs via Skills and built-in file tooling.":{},"Computer use & automation: Anthropic has been developing \"computer use\" capabilities that let Claude interact with desktop software and browser UIs programmatically; this underpins some advanced desktop automation features but is still experimental and constrained.":{},"Desktop extensions & MCP: Extensions and MCP-compatible helpers simplify connecting local services and MCP servers to Claude, reducing installation friction for advanced local integrations.":{},"Enterprise features: Many advanced deployment, security, and integration details (including BYOK, on-prem routing, and fine-grained admin controls) are oriented toward Team and Enterprise customers and are not fully documented in public product pages.":{},"Comparison note: For heavy developer workflows that require CLI-first, git-aware operations and explicit BYOK/local routing, Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI/terminal tool) is a more explicit offering; Claude Desktop is focused on productivity, file workflows, and Skills-driven automation inside a native app.":{},"Key features: autonomous multi-step task execution, \".goosehints\" project guidance, shareable and repeatable \"Recipes\" to capture workflows and make agentic behavior reproducible.":{},"Operational modes: Auto (full autonomy), Approve (prompt before making changes), Chat (suggestions only).":{},"Primary early use-cases: code generation & migrations, test generation, scaffolding, build/perf automation, and other developer productivity tasks.":{},"Strong emphasis on extensibility and preventing vendor lock-in by supporting multiple LLM providers and MCP-based extensions.":{},"Adoption and usefulness will depend on the growth of a healthy extension ecosystem (MCP servers) and high-quality recipes for common workflows.":{},"Key features:":{},"PR summaries and guided walkthroughs of changes":{},"Automated security & quality analysis via many linters and scanners":{},"Code graph / AST analysis to understand cross-file impacts":{},"IDE extensions to bring reviews earlier into the developer workflow":{},"Integrations with issue trackers and chat (Jira, Linear, Slack)":{},"Security / privacy:":{},"Claims SOC2 Type II compliance, ephemeral review environments, end-to-end encryption, and zero data retention after analysis":{},"Uses isolated execution (Google Cloud Run referenced in architecture notes) to reduce risk from analyzing untrusted code":{},"Deployment:":{},"Primary offering is SaaS. Vendor materials mention a self-hosted option for enterprises but public details (architecture, BYOK, on-prem instructions, air-gapped support) are limited—contact vendor for enterprise requirements.":{},"Rebranded to Qodo in 2024; platform and docs may be under either the Codium AI or Qodo name.":{},"Strong fit for teams that need better automated test coverage and PR-level code quality checks rather than just inline code completion.":{},"Provides behavior-coverage driven test generation which aims to produce diverse, behavior-focused tests instead of simple smoke tests.":{},"Offers IDE integrations, CI/CLI tools, and an open-source PR-Agent for self-hosting/CI use-cases.":{},"Enterprise offerings include additional controls and integrations; advanced models (including GPT-4) may be available on paid tiers.":{},"Repositories":{},"https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent":{},"https://github.com/codium-ai/codium-code-examples":{},"https://github.com/codium-ai/codiumai-jetbrains-release":{},"Multi-model support: commonly used with Claude 3, GPT-4, Gemini, Mistral, Groq and local models via Ollama.":{},"Requirements: commonly references Bun (JavaScript runtime), Ollama for local LLMs, Git, and standard development tooling.":{},"Project organization: project-based workspace model with persistent state and task tracking so agents can continue work across sessions.":{},"Research and browsing: built-in research module for fetching and summarizing web documentation, API references, and examples.":{},"Use cases: full-stack feature implementation, repo maintenance, automated testing, documentation generation, and static site deployment.":{},"Community & contribution: open-source repo on GitHub encourages contributions; check repository for issues, contribution guidelines and exact license details.":{},"Distinguishing features: autonomous multi-step planning and execution, long-horizon reasoning across thousands of micro-steps, ability to research (browse docs) and iteratively debug.":{},"Use cases: implementing features, patching bugs in codebases, creating prototypes, running engineering interviews and technical assessments, and integrating changes via Git.":{},"Known demos: autonomous fixes to open-source libraries (e.g., a Sympy patch demo) and building toy/full-stack apps (Game of Life example) in public demos.":{},"Caution: As with any autonomous code-writing system, outputs can be incorrect, insecure, or misaligned with architectural constraints. Human review and sandboxing are critical. Also consider IP, secret handling, and compliance when connecting repos or CI.":{},"Industry context: Part of a broader shift toward autonomous AI agents that take direct action, not just provide suggestions; competes conceptually with other agent-style developer tools but remains distinct from open-source code assistants.":{},"Editions: Community (free, limited Methods Under Test), Developer (paid tiers with higher MUT quotas), Teams and Enterprise (larger-scale, CLI/CI integration, analytics/dashboard and on-prem/enterprise deployment options).":{},"Integrations: IntelliJ plugin, GitHub/GitLab, Jenkins and other CI systems, Docker and common Java build ecosystems (Maven/Gradle/Spring).":{},"Pricing model: free community tier with monthly MUT limits; developer subscriptions with fixed MUT bundles; Teams/Enterprise with capacity- and user-based pricing and bespoke contracts.":{},"Use-cases: fast inner-loop test creation for developers, bulk test generation for legacy codebases, regression testing and coverage improvements, test maintenance during refactors.":{},"Unknown / not publicly documented here: explicit BYOK/key-management details, detailed on-prem installation steps and specific license terms—contact Diffblue sales for enterprise security, on-prem deployment and licensing specifics.":{},"Key features: AI-generated living wiki, code chat / Q&A, architecture diagrams, code transforms/refactors, citations to code lines, notifications on code changes, editable AI docs, prompt-driven code edits, upcoming test-generation features reported.":{},"Integrations: Reported integrations include VS Code, GitHub, Jupyter, and a CLI for local workflows.":{},"Pricing: Not publicly listed in detail; offers standard and enterprise tiers with on-prem/enterprise support — contact sales for pricing.":{},"Project rebranded / continued as \"OpenHands\" (All-Hands-AI/OpenHands); several mirrors/forks exist under the original OpenDevin name.":{},"Primary deployment is Docker-based with a sandbox container for executing shell commands; workspace directories are mounted into the sandbox.":{},"Requires modern Docker, Python 3.10+, and Node.js for full local UI builds and tooling.":{},"Current status: alpha — rapidly changing; default agents have limited capabilities but roadmap includes more robust agent types, evaluation pipelines, and improved UI.":{},"Core value: whole-program synthesis — Smol focuses on producing small, coherent applications from a single natural-language specification rather than only single-file completions.":{},"Usage modes:":{},"Git Repo Mode: operate against a checked-out repository for iterative development and human review.":{},"Library Mode: import smol as a Python package to script generation steps (planning, specifying file paths, generate).":{},"API/Recipe Mode: integrate the agent into higher-level tooling or automated flows.":{},"Prompting DSL: leans on Markdown as the canonical way to describe requirements and specs for the agent.":{},"Good fit: rapid prototyping, scaffolding, learning how to implement features with unfamiliar APIs, and generating small demo apps or PoCs.":{},"Limitations: quality and speed depend heavily on the chosen LLM (GPT-4 is common but slower/costly). The tool is experimental — outputs require human review, testing, and iteration. Not designed as a drop-in replacement for full IDE/code-review workflows.":{},"Offline/local-first: One of the product's main selling points is the ability to run a quantized model locally to avoid sending source code to the cloud — appealing for privacy-sensitive and regulated environments.":{},"Model: Public materials reference an aiXcoder-7B model (quantized) that aims to balance capability and resource usage; vendor material claims strong benchmark performance relative to much larger models in certain code-completion tasks.":{},"Integrations: Official IDE integrations include VS Code, JetBrains (IntelliJ family), and Eclipse, making the tooling accessible within common developer environments.":{},"Features: Method-level code generation (generate a complete function from a description), multi-line/context-aware completions, code search across repos, and refactoring/debugging assistance.":{},"Resource profile: Because the local model is quantized, vendors indicate it can run on modest hardware (4–8GB for very small setups, better experience with 8–16GB and/or modest GPUs), though exact requirements depend on the chosen deployment mode and model precision.":{},"Enterprise options: There are team/enterprise offerings with custom intelligence, private deployment, and analytics for developer efficiency; details and pricing vary by vendor engagement.":{},"Unclear / not publicly confirmed: specific license details for the model and tooling, BYOK (bring-your-own-key) support for cloud features, explicit terminal/CLI tooling support, and whether the project or models are fully open-source. If these are critical, verify with the vendor or product documentation before selecting the tool.":{},"Supported IDEs: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.), Eclipse, and Visual Studio — feature parity varies by IDE (VSCode and JetBrains typically have the richest feature set).":{},"Authentication: Supports AWS Builder ID and IAM Identity Center. Builder ID allows individuals to use Amazon Q without an AWS account; IAM Identity Center sessions for Amazon Q may have extended durations (90 days for setups created on/after 2024-04-18 in some configurations).":{},"Example editor actions: select code → right-click → Amazon Q → Explain / Refactor / Fix / Optimize / Generate Tests / Send to Prompt / Inline Chat.":{},"Documentation generation: a chat command (e.g. `/doc`) can be used to create README or other docs by analyzing the workspace.":{},"Security & reference tracking: inherits capabilities from CodeWhisperer lineage — surfaces potential vulnerabilities, license/reference links when generated code closely matches examples, and provides remediation guidance.":{},"Third-party plugins: Amazon Q supports integrations with monitoring/security providers via a plugin alias system in the AWS Console; examples reported include CloudZero, Datadog, Wiz (these pull provider data via APIs and Q surfaces results and deep links without sending the user's chat content to the provider).":{},"Use cases: onboarding and code comprehension, generating boilerplate, test generation, migrating or modernizing code, documenting projects, security scanning and remediation guidance, and creating AWS infra-aware code snippets.":{},"Limitations: cloud-hosted (no fully local/offline mode), generated code requires human review for correctness/security/licensing, enterprise controls and BYOK options are limited compared to self-hosted offerings.":{},"Related: Amazon CodeWhisperer functionality was consolidated into Amazon Q Developer around April 2024; for legacy references check CodeWhisperer docs (https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/).":{},"Company/platform: positioned as a developer-focused toolkit (modular \"Codi Apps\") and an OpenAI-compatible API gateway that supports multiple model providers.":{},"Privacy: AskCodi advertises no-save behavior for its extensions (privacy-focused by design), but it is primarily a cloud service.":{},"Pricing: offers a Free tier and paid tiers (reported consumer Premium yearly plan around mid-range pricing); paid tiers increase AI credits, access to advanced models, and higher limits.":{},"Integrations: VS Code extension (marketplace), other IDE support (JetBrains/IntelliJ family, Sublime, Neovim and others via community extensions).":{},"Use cases: rapid snippet generation, documentation and docstring creation, unit-test generation, SQL/regex generation, refactoring, and code explanation for onboarding or legacy code comprehension.":{},"Notable strengths: multi-model gateway, modular task-oriented toolset, direct IDE integrations.":{},"Caveats: not open-source and primarily cloud-based; enterprise/local deployment and exact BYOK/local-offline capabilities should be confirmed against AskCodi's current documentation or sales/enterprise channels for sensitive or regulated environments.":{},"Strong focus on enterprise workflows and large monorepos; features include Smart Apply, Next Edit navigation, change checkpoints, persistent memories, and multi-modal inputs (screenshots, Figma).":{},"Industry benchmark claims (HWE Bench top-ranked, e.g., 65.4% on HWE)":{},"Workspace-first UX: users curate a Workspace of files, summaries, diffs and dependency artifacts so the LLM gets focused, relevant context.":{},"Deep Scan: runs a richer analysis over Workspace + instructions and recommends which files to include and in what form (editable, read-only, summary).":{},"Agentic Search: symbol-aware search (classes, methods, fields, usages, call graphs) across the full repo rather than simple text grep.":{},"Action set: Code (apply edits), Ask (question/answers on Workspace), Search (project exploration), Run in Shell (execute commands), Architect (multi-step planning and execution).":{},"Dependency handling: can import and decompile dependencies so the assistant understands third-party code and reduces hallucinations.":{},"Edit Loop: attempts to build/run tests after edits and feeds failures back to the LLM for automated revisions.":{},"Technical stack: Java desktop UI (Swing), Joern for static analysis, Jlama for local/pure-Java LLM inference;

Example pip install: `pip install -U jupyter-cogram` (community references).":{},"Official BYOK and enterprise privacy guarantees for cogram.ai were not found in public docs; some enterprise / privacy language appears associated with the other Cogram product (construction), so exercise caution when evaluating privacy claims.":{},"No official open-source repository for cogram.ai discovered; community/test repos exist but appear unofficial.":{},"Core workflow: user supplies a prompt (CLI or web UI) → agent generates full codebase → creates GitHub repository → provisions DB & auth → runs tests → deploys frontend and backend to live URL.":{},"Infrastructure integrations: Neon (serverless Postgres + Neon Auth) for database and auth; Koyeb (serverless deployments) for hosting/deployments.":{},"Stack examples: React + Vite (frontend), Fastify + Drizzle (backend/ORM), TypeScript throughout the generated projects.":{},"Developer experience: outputs editable code in the user's GitHub account and supports CI/CD (changes pushed to repo trigger redeploys).":{},"Use cases: rapid prototyping, proofs-of-concept, boilerplate acceleration for full-stack apps; can be used as a starting point for production projects with manual review.":{},"Open-source advantage: transparency and ability to self-host or fork the agent and control generated artifacts.":{},"Limitations/considerations: depends on remote LLMs and hosted infra; may require reviewing and hardening generated code before using in production; BYOK/enterprise model key options and advanced integrations may require additional configuration.":{},"Sources: coverage gathered from platform README and third-party posts about app.build (Neon/Koyeb posts, GitHub repo).":{},"Multi-LLM architecture: supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, Groq, and others.":{},"Uses StackBlitz WebContainers for a full browser-based dev environment with NPM support and hot reload.":{},"Installation paths: Cloud (browser), Local (Node.js + pnpm), Docker.":{},"Good for prototyping, migrating legacy apps, and experimenting with multiple LLMs.":{},"Export options: ZIP export, deploy to Netlify/Cloudflare, Docker image.":{},"Built on StackBlitz WebContainers tech to run a real Node.js environment fully in the browser.":{},"AI can generate both frontend and backend code, wire databases (examples: Supabase), and deploy to platforms like Netlify/Cloudflare with minimal friction.":{},"Great fit for prototyping, demos, learning, and quick experiments where zero local setup is a priority.":{},"Not designed for fully offline/local development or for bringing your own model; it is a cloud/browser service with proprietary components.":{},"Good integration for teams wanting fast iteration cycles, but teams that require self‑hosted or open‑source tooling may find limitations.":{},"Privacy: Multiple sources emphasize a local-first design where code and data remain on the user's machine; network calls appear limited to OpenAI API usage.":{},"Features reported: semantic code search, natural-language-to-SQL, integrated terminal, Git integration, project scaffolding, file creation and updates, ability to execute shell commands and read outputs.":{},"Pricing/details: I could not find an official pricing page or clear subscription tiers in the public third-party descriptions. The vendor appears to support BYOK (use your OpenAI API key), which means costs for model usage are borne by the user via their OpenAI account.":{},"Open-source status: No authoritative indication that the desktop app is open source. There is an unrelated community project named codecompanion.nvim (a Neovim plugin) on GitHub; do not confuse the two.":{},"Documentation: Public, authoritative documentation or an official product site with detailed specs/pricing was not discovered in the sources I reviewed. Recommend checking the vendor domain (https://codecompanion.ai) and any official docs or contact channels for the latest details before deployment or purchase.":{},"Research summary based on multiple third-party write-ups and product summaries; authoritative vendor documentation and pricing were not found in the search results available.":{},"Pricing tiers (public info at time of research):":{},"Free / Starter: limited monthly actions (about 100), 1 project, community support":{},"Pro: ~$28/month — larger action quota (~10k/mo), multiple projects":{},"Agency: ~$68/month — unlimited actions, unlimited projects, team features":{},"Key strengths:":{},"WordPress-focused outputs that save time for common WP tasks":{},"Specialized modes for major plugins and page builders help generate compatible code":{},"Ability to export generated snippets as a plugin simplifies deployment":{},"Large searchable snippets library and tutorials at https://codewp.ai/snippets/":{},"Not open source — code generation is a hosted service":{},"Limited built-in Git or terminal integration; workflow expects copying generated code into your WP projects or using the plugin export":{},"Review generated code and test in staging — as with all AI-generated code, manual review is recommended for security and compatibility":{},"Sources & further reading:":{},"https://codewp.ai/":{},"https://codewp.ai/snippets/":{},"Key features: \"Complete Code\" (inline suggestions), \"Explain Code\" (natural-language explanations), \"Transform Code\" (refactors/rewrites), and \"Generate Code\" (from prompts).":{},"Pricing is tiered: Starter (free) with limited resources; Core (individual pro tier, commonly around $20/month with monthly credits when billed annually); Teams (team plans around $35/user/month annually with extra credits and collaboration features); Enterprise (custom pricing, SSO/SCIM and enterprise controls available).":{},"Billing uses a credit model: agent/AI compute, deployments and some resources consume credits; heavy usage can increase costs beyond subscription fees.":{},"Deployments: static deploys can be free but autoscale/reserved VM deployments carry additional costs starting from low-dollar/month tiers upward.":{},"Privacy/enterprise controls: enterprise plans advertise SSO and provisioning (SAML/SCIM). Public docs do not disclose BYOK, data residency or detailed data-retention controls — contact Replit sales for enterprise privacy/data-residency specifics.":{},"Models and internals: Replit does not publicly document exact model names or weights used by Ghostwriter; descriptions reference \"frontier\" or large-generation models in marketing material.":{},"Use cases: excellent for browser-first workflows, teaching, pair-programming, quick refactors and prototyping. Not suitable when strict on-premises, BYOK, or fully offline operation is required.":{},"Recommendation: for teams with strict compliance needs, engage Replit Enterprise sales to confirm options (SSO, data handling, contractual terms). For individual users, Core provides a convenient integrated experience with monthly usage credits.":{},"Visual app builder with ~60+ UI components (tables, charts, forms, lists, etc.)":{},"75+ data source connectors (SQL/NoSQL, REST, GraphQL, SaaS APIs, cloud storage, LLMs)":{},"Built-in ToolJet Database (Postgres-based editor) for quick data-driven apps":{},"Workflow automation and server-side actions":{},"Ability to run JS/Python for custom logic and transformations":{},"Extensible via plugins, custom connectors, and CLI":{},"AI & Enterprise features:":{},"Natural-language AI App Generation (generate app scaffolding from prompts)":{},"AI Query Builder and AI Debugging utilities":{},"Agent Builder for automating workflows":{},"Advanced security, SSO, audit logs, and fine-grained RBAC in enterprise plans":{},"Security & deployment:":{},"Supports self-hosting (Docker/Kubernetes) and cloud deployments (AWS/GCP/Azure)":{},"Encryption and proxy-only data flows advertised; enterprise features include compliance controls":{},"Pricing summary (high-level):":{},"Community Edition: free and open-source":{},"Paid tiers: monthly per-builder / per-seat pricing for hosted and team features; enterprise/custom pricing for large deployments and SLA/support":{},"Pricing and feature boundaries for AI capabilities vary; many AI conveniences are enterprise-tier features":{},"Limitations / considerations:":{},"Self-hosting and scaling require infra expertise (K8s/Docker, DB management)":{},"Complex data transformations sometimes need custom code (JS/Python)":{},"Some advanced AI and enterprise features behind paid plans":{},"Generated apps may still require manual refinement for production-grade behaviour and security":{},"MCP Support":{},"Tooljet has native API integrations":{},"Tooljet does not support MCP Servers":{},"Tooljet itself has an MCP server , so can integrate with your MCP clients":{},"Official site: https://www.tooljet.com/":{},"Docs: https://docs.tooljet.com/":{},"GitHub: https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet":{},"Product: https://v0.dev (primary site)":{},"Alternate entry: https://v0.app":{},"Vercel: https://vercel.com":{},"Primary use case: SEO and lead generation. Interactive tools increase time‑on‑site and can be optimized for keyword targets.":{},"UX: Drag‑and‑drop/no‑code builder → quick to launch; good for non‑technical users and marketers.":{},"Integrations: Embeds via script/iframe, email capture, webhooks; analytics for engagement and conversions.":{},"Pricing (reported in public materials during beta): starts at around $29/month for paid tier; tiering and limits apply.":{},"Limitations: Not intended for building full web applications or heavily customized backend logic. Customization beyond the provided builder can be limited; vendor lock‑in for hosted tools.":{},"Security: Platform claims encrypted transmission and secure storage for collected leads (standard for SaaS tools) — verify for specific compliance needs.":{},"BYOK model: users supply API keys for whichever LLM provider they choose (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.), allowing control over costs and provider choice.":{},"Local/model support: Aider can connect to local LLMs (self-hosted or via local runtimes), enabling fully offline workflows and private model usage.":{},"Cost optimization: Supports prompt-caching patterns and lets you choose cheaper models or local models to reduce usage costs.":{},"Workflow strengths: deep Git integration (auto-commit with sensible commit messages, undo commit, diff), in-chat file management (/add, /drop), lint/test runs, and automatic retries/fixes when tests fail.":{},"UX features: terminal-first chat, optional web GUI, voice input, ability to ingest web pages/images for context, and pointing to CONVENTIONS.md to enforce project-specific rules.":{},"Installation: pip-based installer (e.g., python -m pip install aider-install; then run aider-install), then run aider in a repo with your chosen model and API key.":{},"Good fit for: teams wanting repo-aware AI edits, those requiring private/local model runs, developers who prefer CLI workflows and Git-backed safety for AI edits.":{},"Limitations/considerations: Aider is a thin orchestration layer — actual model behavior, costs, and availability depend on chosen LLM provider or local runtime; evaluate model performance and token costs for your use case before large-scale adoption.":{},"Models: Offers multiple model tiers (commonly referenced as Opus (highest capability), Sonnet (workhorse), and Haiku (cost-efficient)). Opus is aimed at deep reasoning and large refactors; Sonnet balances cost and capability; Haiku is optimized for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks.":{},"Pricing: Available as seat-based subscriptions (Pro, Max tiers) and pay-as-you-go API token pricing. High-capability models (Opus) carry premium token costs; Sonnet often provides a better cost/performance tradeoff for everyday coding.":{},"Context window: Claude-family models marketed with very large context windows (useful for large repositories and multi-file edits).":{},"Platform support: macOS, Linux, Windows (CLI-first). Windows usage commonly requires Git for Windows for full CLI feature parity.":{},"Use cases: automated refactors, multi-file PR generation, test generation and repair, code review assistance, automated CI hooks, developer productivity automation.":{},"Safety & controls: interactive permission prompts, enterprise controls for data handling, and options to route through organization-managed endpoints.":{},"Ecosystem: community tooling and integrations exist (context engineers, wrappers, \"awesome\" lists) though the official product is closed-source.":{},"Further reading: consult the official Claude documentation at https://claude.ai/ and Anthropic's product pages for up-to-date pricing, model names, and deployment options.":{},"Supports multiple model providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Groq and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints) via configuration and gateways.":{},"Configuration stored in ~/.codex/config.toml; users can create reusable prompts and agent settings per-repo.":{},"Operational modes:":{},"Suggest (default): proposes edits and commands; requires user approval before applying changes.":{},"Auto Edit: autonomously reads/writes files, but asks before executing shell commands.":{},"Full Auto: performs reads, writes, and executes commands in a sandboxed, network-disabled environment without additional prompts.":{},"AGENTS.md: repository-level guidance files can be added to help the agent understand project structure, test commands, and conventions.":{},"Useful for exploratory code tasks, automated refactors, running test-fix cycles, and generating PR-ready diffs; best results when the repository includes clear tests and documentation.":{},"Strong privacy posture: can run entirely with local models so source code does not need to be uploaded to third-party APIs.":{},"Rich tool set that mirrors common CLI developer actions (ls, grep, view, write, edit, patch, bash) so it can operate robustly on repositories.":{},"Useful workflow modes: Plan mode (no edits, design/strategy) and Build mode (apply changes). Includes undo/redo for edits.":{},"Integrates with LSP/diagnostics for precise error detection and fixes.":{},"Extensible via custom actions/skills and supports spawning sub-agents for task decomposition.":{},"Good fit for polyglot environments and CI/CD automation where a terminal-first interface and scriptability are advantages.":{},"Main website: https://opencode.ai — repo and docs live at https://github.com/sst/opencode":{},"Key features: Agent Mode (natural language -> commands), Warp Code (diff-tracking and stepwise code edits by agents), Drive (shared Workflows and Notebooks), Planning Mode and multi-agent orchestration.":{},"Privacy controls: granular autonomy settings (allowlists/denylists, pause/approve diffs, control file access), network logging, and zero-data-retention guarantees for enterprise customers.":{},"Strengths: Unified UX for prompt + shell input, native diff review for agent-made changes, strong collaboration primitives for teams.":{},"Limitations / unknowns: public documentation is limited on BYOK (bring-your-own-key) and fully offline local LLM operation; product is proprietary which may limit on-premise customization for some organizations.":{},"Recommended when: you want a first-class terminal with integrated AI agents and team sharing (Drive), and you prefer an opinionated, commercial product with enterprise privacy controls rather than an open-source self-hosted solution.":{}}}},{"Classification":{"name":"Classification","type":"LABEL","search":true,"table":true,"detail":true,"description":{"template":"Default description for {}","variables":["name"]},"placeholder":{"template":"Select {} ...","variables":["name"]},"order":"","andSearch":false,"rangeSearch":false,"values":{"Yes":{"display":"✅"},"No":{"displayHtml":"<span class=\"status status-no\">✖</span>"},"Code/Editor":{}}}},{"SpecDrivenDevelopment":{"name":"SpecDrivenDevelopment","type":"MARKDOWN","search":false,"table":true,"detail":true,"description":"","placeholder":"","order":"","andSearch":false,"rangeSearch":false}}]}
