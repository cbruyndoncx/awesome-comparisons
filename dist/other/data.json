strong community support.    \n- **2025-2026 updates:**    \n- CAUTION: \"Testify AI\" as an AI-powered test assistant at github.com/testify-ai/testify-ai could not be independently verified via public search as of January 2026.    \n- The well-known \"testify\" projects (stretchr/testify for Go, Yelp/Testify for Python) are traditional testing frameworks, not AI test assistants.    \n- stretchr/testify released v1.11.1 (Aug 27, 2025) with performance improvements and bug fixes, but this is a different product.    \n- Verify this entry's repo URL and product claims before relying on
