The platform reached #1 on Product Hunt and is trusted by approximately 200,000 builders.\n\nUnlike template-based no-code builders, Mocha actually writes code that users own and can export. The platform provides an all-in-one stack with built-in authentication, database, backend API, hosting, and deployment with zero setup required. Users can iterate on designs through a chat interface, switch to dev mode for direct code editing, or use direct edit mode for text changes without consuming credits."}]},{"type":"header","level":3,"content":"Languages","children":[{"type":"list","level":3,"children":[{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"TypeScript","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"JavaScript","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"React framework for frontend","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Hono framework for API endpoints","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"HTML/CSS","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Generated as part of React components","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"SQL","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"SQLite database","plainChildren":""}]}]},{"type":"header","level":3,"content":"Notes","children":[{"type":"list","level":3,"children":[{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Core strengths:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Vibe coding: Describe desired app functionality with words or images and iterate through conversational interface","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"True all-in-one stack: Backend, database, authentication, payments, hosting with zero configuration","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Code ownership: Export complete project code at any time with full freedom to modify and deploy elsewhere","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Opinionated tech stack: TypeScript + React + Hono + SQLite eliminates decision paralysis","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Cloudflare deployment: Automatic hosting and deployment with custom domain support","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Developer features:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Dev Mode: View and edit code directly with real-time preview updates","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Direct Edit Mode: Click-to-edit text without consuming credits","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Discuss Mode: Conversational planning and debugging assistance","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"API integration: Connect external backends by providing API keys","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Pricing (2025-2026):","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Starter: Free with 120 credits, deploy 1 app","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Bronze: $20/month for 1,500 credits, publish up to 5 apps, custom domains","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Silver: $50/month for 4,500 credits, publish up to 15 apps, priority support","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Gold: $200/month for 20,000 credits, publish up to 25 apps, early access to new features","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"All paid plans support custom domains and watermark removal","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Limitations and considerations:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"No custom tech stacks: Cannot bring your own frameworks or libraries","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"No external deployment: Must use Cloudflare hosting (though code can be exported)","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"No Figma import: Screenshots and descriptions serve as alternatives","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"App complexity limits vary by subscription tier","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Generated code should be reviewed for accessibility, security, and edge-case handling","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"Typical workflow:","plainChildren":""},{"type":"item","level":3,"content":"1.
