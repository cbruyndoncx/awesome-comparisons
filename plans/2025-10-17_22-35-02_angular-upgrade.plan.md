# Plan: Modernize Angular Application for Node 20 Compatibility

The current project runs on Angular 5 (Webpack 3, TypeScript 2.6) and targets older Node versions. Goal: document the Angular code base via Tessl specs and upgrade the application to a modern Angular release that runs with Node 20+, while deprecating unused Java tooling in favor of existing Python scripts.

## Tasks

- [x] Audit the existing Angular code structure and dependency versions to inform the upgrade scope
  > **Bash**
  > ```
  > {"command":["bash","-lc","cat package.json"],"workdir":".","timeout_ms":120000}

  > Identified Angular 5.2.x stack (Webpack 3, TypeScript 2.6.2, TSLint 5) and legacy build scripts relying on Gulp 4 with Node <12 assumptions.
  > ---
  > **Bash**
  > ```
  > {"command":["bash","-lc","ls src/app"],"workdir":".","timeout_ms":120000}

- [x] Replace legacy Node `util` imports in Angular code with a shared helper compatible with Angular 17
  > **Tessl Create** `specs/app/shared/null-check.spec.md` â€“ generated `src/app/shared/util/null-check.ts` with tree-shakable null-check helper (default/named exports + compatibility alias).
  >
  > **Apply Patch** updated imports across Angular sources (`comparison.component.ts`, configuration service, reducers, number/select inputs) to consume the new helper.
  >
  > **Tessl Edit** refreshed component spec (`specs/app/components/comparison-component.spec.md`) to call out the shared null-check dependency.
- [x] Migrate legacy UI dependencies (ng2-select, anchor-js, Polymer checkbox) to Angular 17-friendly implementations
  > **Apply Patch** rewrote `src/app/components/input/select2/select2.component.ts/html/css` to a dependency-free button-based multi-select, updated `input.module.ts` (switch to `CommonModule`), and documented behavior via `specs/app/components/input/select2.spec.md`.
  >
  > **Apply Patch** modernized `PaperCheckboxComponent` to use `Renderer2`-free bindings with accessibility host bindings, plus new spec `specs/app/components/polymer/paper-checkbox.spec.md` and module updates (`polymer.module.ts`).
  >
  > **Apply Patch** replaced AnchorJS usage with internal anchor generation in `generic-table.component.ts`, removing the external dependency entirely.
- [x] Update Redux action classes and other TypeScript constructs to satisfy Angular 17/TS 5 compiler checks
  > **Apply Patch** added `override` keywords and tightened type annotations in `src/app/redux/uc.action.ts`; resolved missing returns in `searchElement`.
  >
  > **Apply Patch** simplified number-input template binding and ensured Select2 `addToGui` contract remained intact.
  >
  > **Shell** `MD_TO_JSON_COMMAND="python ../../md2json/md2json.py" npm run build` â€“ build now succeeds (warnings remain for optional CommonJS deps & unused legacy files but no compilation errors).
