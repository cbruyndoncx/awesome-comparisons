# Plan: Fix duplicate group labels in search UI

Investigate why group headers (e.g., MCP-Client, Extensible) still show duplicate labels despite prior logic, and ensure the Angular bundle receives the expected grouping metadata.

## Tasks

- [ ] Inspect the generated `dist/comparison.json` and runtime store state to confirm whether `featureGroups` includes `primaryCriteria`.
- [ ] Trace the UI rendering to see if the template conditions fire (console/log state or simplify HTML), and adjust template/CSS accordingly.
- [ ] Verify after the fix by running `npm run build` and checking the search UI.
