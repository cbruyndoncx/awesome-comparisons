# Plan: Allow md2json to parse `#Title` headers

The markdown data files use `#Title` without a space, so the converter currently skips every entry. Update the spec/code so any line starting with `#` (with or without a space) counts as a title/header.

## Tasks

- [x] Update the md2json converter spec to note headers may omit the space after `#`.
  > **Edit** `apply_patch` (specs/lib/md2json/md2json.spec.md)
  >
  > Clarified that the title detection treats any line beginning with `#` (with or without spaces) as the entry header so files like `#Title` are valid.
- [x] Regenerate the converter implementation from the spec.
  > **MCP** `tessl - build`
  > - spec: ["specs/lib/md2json/md2json.spec.md"]
  >
  > Rebuilt [lib/md2json/md2json.ts](../lib/md2json/md2json.ts) so the logic now matches the updated header requirements; also updated the companion tests via `tessl build-tests`.
  > ---
  > **Edit** `apply_patch` (lib/md2json/md2json.ts)``
  >
  > Tweaked the description and entry-break detection to treat `#Title` (without a space) as a top-level header, matching the data set.
  > ---
  > **Bash** `{"command":["bash","-lc","npm run md2json:compile"],"workdir":"/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate-comparison-framework","with_escalated_permissions":true,"justification":"Recompile md2json TypeScript after header parsing changes."}`
  >
  > Re-emitted the CLI so gulp picks up the new parser.
- [x] Rerun `npm run data:prepare` to confirm `dist/data.json` is produced successfully.
  > **Bash** `{"command":["bash","-lc","npm run data:prepare"],"workdir":"/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate/ultimate-comparison-framework","with_escalated_permissions":true,"justification":"Verify gulp pipeline after CLI fix.","timeout_ms":120000}`
  >
  > Pipeline now completes without errors, regenerating `dist/data.json` plus downstream outputs; prior ENOENT errors are resolved.
