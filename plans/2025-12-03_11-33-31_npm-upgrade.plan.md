# Plan: NPM Upgrade

Upgrade project dependencies via npm and ensure the application still builds successfully.

## Tasks

- [x] Audit current dependencies and identify upgrade scope
  > **Bash** `npm outdated`
  > - workdir: `/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate/awesome-comparisons`
  > - timeout_ms: `120000`
  >
  > Command failed because network access was blocked (EAI_AGAIN). No files changed.
  > ---
  > **Bash** `npm outdated`
  > - workdir: `/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate/awesome-comparisons`
  > - timeout_ms: `120000`
  > - with_escalated_permissions: `true`
  > - justification: `Need network access to query npm registry for outdated dependencies`
  >
  > Listed outdated packages across Angular, NgRx, and build tooling, confirming scope for npm upgrade.
- [x] Perform npm upgrade and refresh lockfile
  > **Bash** `npm upgrade`
  > - workdir: `/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate/awesome-comparisons`
  > - timeout_ms: `120000`
  > - with_escalated_permissions: `true`
  > - justification: `Need network access to fetch updated package versions for npm upgrade`
  >
  > Upgraded dependencies within existing semver ranges, removing 6 packages, adding 13, and rewriting the lockfile. Logged deprecation notices for transitive packages and flagged 34 audit vulnerabilities for later review. Changes captured in [package-lock.json](../package-lock.json).
- [x] Verify application builds cleanly after the upgrade
  > **Bash** `npm run build`
  > - workdir: `/home/cb/projects/github/ultimate/awesome-comparisons`
  > - timeout_ms: `120000`
  >
  > Full dataset-aware production build completed successfully (tsc + gulp + Angular CLI). Resulting assets emitted to [dist](../dist). Build surfaced existing warnings (Angular Material duplicate theme styles, CommonJS dep warning for `hogan.js`, and unused environment/vendor entry points) but no new errors.
