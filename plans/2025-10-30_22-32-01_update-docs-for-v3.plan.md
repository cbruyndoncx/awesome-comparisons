# Plan: Update top-level documentation for v3 (Ultimate Comparisons v3)

Goal

Update and expand the top-level markdown documentation to reflect the v3 fork (multi-dataset support), provide a migration guide for v2 users, and create a docs/uc-v3 structure similar to the original docs/uc-v2 so both new users and v2 users can understand and migrate to v3.

Background

This repository is a v3 fork of the Ultimate Comparison Framework. The legacy documentation for v2 is available at `docs/uc-v2/`. v3 introduces multi-dataset support, dataset-aware CLI and build outputs, and some breaking changes. The top-level markdown files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES_V3.md, etc.) should be updated to reflect v3 behavior and point to a new docs/uc-v3 folder with migration instructions and updated deployment/CI docs.

Plan Overview (tasks)

- [ ] Audit existing top-level markdown files and identify where v3 changes are required
  - Expected output: list of files and a short note for each describing required changes
- [ ] Create a new docs/uc-v3/ directory with v3-focused documentation
  - Files to create (initial):
    - `docs/uc-v3/Overview.md` (what's new in v3, high-level concepts)
    - `docs/uc-v3/Migration_From_v2.md` (step-by-step migration guide)
    - `docs/uc-v3/Update_YOUR_Comparison.md` (updated instructions for maintainers)
    - `docs/uc-v3/CI_and_Deploy.md` (updated Travis/GitHub Actions / gh-pages guidance)
    - `docs/uc-v3/adr/` (copy of ADR index or references)
  - Expected output: files created under `docs/uc-v3/`
- [ ] Update `README.md` to be v3-first, include quickstart for new users and short migration steps for v2 users, with links to docs/uc-v3
  - Expected output: modified `README.md`
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` to reference `CHANGELOG_V3.md` and add a short summary entry for v3 release
  - Expected output: modified `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Ensure `RELEASE_NOTES_V3.md`, `CHANGELOG_V3.md`, and `CHANGELOG_V3_DETAILED.md` are consistent and linked from top-level docs
  - Expected output: cross-links added
- [ ] Add a short `docs/index.md` or top-level `docs/README.md` that points to `docs/uc-v3` and `docs/uc-v2` for clarity
  - Expected output: created `docs/README.md`
- [ ] Add examples and snippets that demonstrate dataset structure, `datasets/<name>/` layout, and CLI usage (`--dataset`, `--all-datasets`)
  - Expected output: examples included in Migration_From_v2.md and Update_YOUR_Comparison.md
- [ ] Review license and contribution notes in top-level docs and make sure they are not referencing v2-only behaviors
  - Expected output: minor edits where needed
- [ ] Ask for review and finalize changes (user approval)

Files to edit / create (proposal)

- Edit: README.md (top-level)
- Edit: CHANGELOG.md
- Edit: RELEASE_NOTES_V3.md (minor cross-linking)
- Create: docs/uc-v3/Overview.md
- Create: docs/uc-v3/Migration_From_v2.md
- Create: docs/uc-v3/Update_YOUR_Comparison.md
- Create: docs/uc-v3/CI_and_Deploy.md
- Create: docs/README.md (index)

How I will approach the work

1. Present this plan for your review. Do not change repository files until I get explicit approval to proceed.
2. Once you approve, I will:
   - Create the `docs/uc-v3/` files and the `docs/README.md` index.
   - Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
   - Run a quick consistency check (search for v2 terminology that must be updated).
3. Provide a final pass and ask you to review the docs for tone, missing examples, or additions.

Questions for you (quick)

- Do you want the new docs to live under `docs/uc-v3/` (side-by-side with `docs/uc-v2/`) or should I replace `docs/uc-v2/` with the v3 content in `docs/`?
- Do you prefer GitHub Actions examples for CI, or keep references to Travis where applicable? (I can include both if you want.)

Notes about project process (Tessl)

- I created this plan file according to the project's plan-file rules. When I begin making edits I will update this plan file and include a verbatim record of every tool call used to perform edits (per the plan-file requirements).
