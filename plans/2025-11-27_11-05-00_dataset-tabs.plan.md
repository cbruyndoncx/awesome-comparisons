# Plan: Hide empty datasets from UI tabs

Goal: Show dataset tabs only when their generated assets (data/config) exist so users don't see empty placeholder tabs.

## Tasks

- [x] Identify how the UI currently loads datasets/data and determine the best signal for "dataset has data".
  > **Bash** `['bash','-lc','rg -n "datasets" src -g"*.ts"']`
  > Located dataset-related Angular services/components to inspect the data flow.
  > ---
  > **Bash** `['bash','-lc','sed -n '\''1,240p'\'' src/app/components/datasets/dataset-manifest.service.ts']`
  > Reviewed [dataset-manifest.service.ts](../src/app/components/datasets/dataset-manifest.service.ts) to confirm tabs are driven entirely by manifest entries sorted client-side.
  > ---
  > **Bash** `['bash','-lc','sed -n '\''120,220p'\'' src/app/components/comparison/configuration/configuration.service.ts']`
  > Verified comparison loading hits `assetDirectory/data.json` & `comparison.json`, so the presence of those files is a reliable proxy for "dataset has data".
  >
  > Outcome: solution is to filter manifest entries by checking whether `assetDirectory/data.json` exists at runtime (e.g., via HEAD requests) before populating the tabs.
- [x] Update dataset manifest loading (or related services) to filter out entries lacking generated data assets.
  > **Apply Patch** *(parameters summarized; updated [dataset-manifest.service.ts](../src/app/components/datasets/dataset-manifest.service.ts))*
  > Added HEAD checks for each dataset's `data.json`, filtering the manifest to entries whose assets exist (with a fallback if none are reachable) before populating the tab list.
- [ ] Verify tabs only show datasets with assets (dev server + build) and ensure fallbacks remain when no dataset has data.
  > **Bash** `['bash','-lc','npm run build -- --dataset code-editor']`
  > Ensured the Angular build succeeds with the new manifest filtering logic; UI port binding isn't available in this environment, so manual verification of tab rendering should be done locally.
