# Plan: Implement Accessible Angular Theming

Deliver a Material-driven light/dark/system theming experience with persistence and dataset integration per `specs/app/theme/theme-service.spec.md`.

## Tasks

- [ ] Scaffold ThemeService from spec (observable state, matchMedia detection, dataset syncing)
- [ ] Generate `src/styles/theme.scss` Material theme definitions and wire them into global styles
- [ ] Add UI controls (icon toggle) to DatasetShell to cycle themes with ARIA/tooltip updates
- [ ] Persist theme selection, announce changes, and ensure overlay container + body classes stay in sync
- [ ] Validate implementation with unit tests/mocks for matchMedia/localStorage + manual smoke test across datasets
