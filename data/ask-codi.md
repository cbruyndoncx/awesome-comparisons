## Description
AskCodi is an AI-powered coding assistant and OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway developed to help developers generate, explain, refactor, document, and test code. It combines a suite of focused developer tools (branded as "Codi Apps") with IDE extensions and an API that lets teams call multiple LLM providers through a single endpoint. AskCodi emphasizes practical developer workflows — inline completions, chat, code explanation, unit-test generation, SQL/regex builders, and automated refactors — and aims to reduce context-switching by integrating directly into popular editors.

## Notes
- Company/platform: positioned as a developer-focused toolkit (modular "Codi Apps") and an OpenAI-compatible API gateway that supports multiple model providers.  
- Privacy: AskCodi advertises no-save behavior for its extensions (privacy-focused by design), but it is primarily a cloud service.  
- Pricing: offers a Free tier and paid tiers (reported consumer Premium yearly plan around mid-range pricing); paid tiers increase AI credits, access to advanced models, and higher limits.  
- Integrations: VS Code extension (marketplace), other IDE support (JetBrains/IntelliJ family, Sublime, Neovim and others via community extensions).  
- Use cases: rapid snippet generation, documentation and docstring creation, unit-test generation, SQL/regex generation, refactoring, and code explanation for onboarding or legacy code comprehension.  
- Notable strengths: multi-model gateway, modular task-oriented toolset, direct IDE integrations.  
- Caveats: not open-source and primarily cloud-based; enterprise/local deployment and exact BYOK/local-offline capabilities should be confirmed against AskCodi's current documentation or sales/enterprise channels for sensitive or regulated environments.
