# Nuanced MCP Server - https://nuanced.ai
Nuanced provides compiler-grade code intelligence (call graphs, symbols, types, dataflow) to AI coding agents via an MCP server that runs analysis locally and serves precise context slices to LLMs.

## Description
Nuanced is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and code-intelligence layer that supplies AI coding assistants with compiler-grade facts about a repository: static call graphs, symbol tables (fully-qualified names and paths), inferred types, dataflow and control-flow information. Rather than sending raw file text or embeddings, Nuanced serves on-demand subgraphs of precisely the code relevant to a prompt, enabling agents to follow real call chains across files, reason about downstream impact ("blast radius"), and reduce hallucinations. Its design emphasizes local-first analysis so that repository code and analysis results remain on user infrastructure while providing integration points for IDEs, CI, and custom agents.

## BYOK


## LocalOffline
- Yes
  Local-first MCP server: analysis runs on the user's machine or infrastructure; code/context does not need to be uploaded to external APIs.

## FreeTrial

## GitSupport
- Yes

## Terminal
- Yes
  Provides an npm package and CLI for setup/configuration; integrates with developer workflows.

## Opensource
- Yes
  Nuanced began as an open-source call-graph/context library; core components have been published for community use.

## License


## MCPSupport
- Yes
  Nuanced is explicitly implemented as an MCP server to deliver structured code context to LLM-based agents.

## Notes
- Built by former GitHub engineers experienced in large-scale code intelligence and search.
- Key capabilities: static call graphs, symbol-level context, inferred types, dataflow/control-flow facts, and on-demand context subgraphs for prompts.
- Integrations: used with AI assistants and tools (examples reported: Cursor, Claude Code, Codex workflows) and integrates with LSP tooling and IDEs.
- Benefits: reduces LLM token spend (reported up to ~33% in company materials), improves accuracy of generated code, limits hallucinations by giving models precise code facts, and helps predict downstream impact of edits.
- Language support: strong TypeScript support, official Python support announced; company advertises support for eight languages in total with broader support available via enterprise offerings.
- Deployment: installable via npm (npm package / CLI), configured as an MCP server; designed to run locally or on-prem for secure codebases.
- Tradeoffs/Unknowns: full license details and exact language-by-language feature parity are not always documented in public materials; enterprise features and expanded language support may be gated under paid plans.
- Good fit for: teams using LLMs to assist coding on large/complex repos, organizations requiring local analysis for security/privacy, and tooling vendors building LLM-powered code assistants.
