## Description
OpenDevin is an open-source project that implements an autonomous AI software engineer: an agent capable of planning, writing, debugging, and executing code within a controlled workspace. The project provides a web UI, chat interface, terminal/sandbox for running bash commands, and integrations for large language model backends. The codebase is modular, container-first (Docker), and designed for community contributions and experimentation with autonomous developer agents.

## Notes
- Project rebranded / continued as "OpenHands" (All-Hands-AI/OpenHands); several mirrors/forks exist under the original OpenDevin name.
- Primary deployment is Docker-based with a sandbox container for executing shell commands; workspace directories are mounted into the sandbox.
- Requires modern Docker, Python 3.10+, and Node.js for full local UI builds and tooling. 
- Current status: alpha â€” rapidly changing; default agents have limited capabilities but roadmap includes more robust agent types, evaluation pipelines, and improved UI.
