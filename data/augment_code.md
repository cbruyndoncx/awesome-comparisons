## Description
Augment Code is an AI-first development platform built to help professional engineers work with large, complex codebases. It uses a high-capacity context engine (advertised ~200k tokens of context), continuous embeddings of code and docs, and persistent "Memories" to provide deeply contextual completions, autonomous agents, and stepwise "Next Edit" navigation through multi-file changes. It supports autonomous agents that can plan, build, and open pull requests, and integrates with many developer tools and infra via MCP and native integrations.
