## Description
CodeLayer is an open-source, keyboard-first IDE and orchestration layer for AI coding agents (built on top of Claude Code). It focuses on "context engineering" and workflow orchestration so teams can use multiple AI agents in parallel to solve complex problems across large codebases. Key platform ideas include parallel Claude Code sessions (MULTICLAUDE), battle-tested agent workflows, worktree-aware git operations, and ergonomics for fast, keyboard-driven developer flows.

## Notes
- Focus: orchestration of AI agents rather than just code completion — useful for teams working on large, legacy, or complex systems.
- Innovative features: Advanced Context Engineering and MULTICLAUDE (parallel Claude Code sessions across worktrees and cloud workers).
- Community & activity: ~5.5k stars, ~409 forks (active contributions and many releases; rapid iteration cadence).
- Polyglot codebase: frontend/tooling in TypeScript, backend/perf in Go; other languages for utilities.
- Use cases: team-scale AI-assisted development, PR generation/augmentation, multi-agent workflows, productivity tooling for dev teams.
- Caveats: depends on Claude Code (Anthropic) for core model capabilities, so on-prem / fully local usage is limited unless adapted by contributors.
- License is permissive (Apache 2.0) — good for commercial adoption and modification.
- Repo contains legacy HumanLayer SDK and documentation for historical context and SDK features.
