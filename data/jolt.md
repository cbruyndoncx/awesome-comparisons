## Description
Jolt is a commercial AI coding assistant designed for large production codebases (100K+ lines). It emphasizes global "HyperContext" awareness of an entire codebase so users can ask questions, make changes, and apply multi-file edits without manually selecting context files. Jolt can generate implementation plans, create coherent multi-file patches, locate root causes for bugs from logs, and help with documentation and refactors across big repositories.

## Notes
- Core differentiator: "HyperContext" â€” Jolt maintains awareness of the whole codebase to reliably surface relevant files and produce consistent multi-file edits.
- Integrations: Web app, desktop app, and IDE extensions (notably VS Code and Cursor).
- Models & backends: Uses a mix of LLM providers (publicly referenced: Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI) for generation and search.
- Security & compliance: Marketed for enterprise use and claims SOC 2 Type II compliance for handling sensitive codebases.
- Target audience: Engineering teams working on large, legacy or multi-repo production systems where single-file assistants struggle.
- Common workflows: Chat-based edits for smaller changes, editable implementation plans for complex multi-file work, and automatic context discovery across repos and dependencies.
