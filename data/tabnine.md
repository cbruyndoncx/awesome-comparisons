## Description
Tabnine is a commercial AI coding assistant that emphasizes privacy, flexible deployment, and broad IDE coverage. It provides context-aware inline code completions, an in-IDE chat for code explanation and refactoring, and organization-aware suggestions that learn from your repository and coding patterns. Tabnine targets teams and enterprises that need strong data governance — offering private, on-premises, VPC, and air-gapped deployment models as well as local model execution options so source code can be kept inside controlled environments.

## Notes
- Strengths: strong privacy and governance features (SSO/SAML, SCIM, role-based access controls), flexible deployment (cloud, private cloud/VPC, on-prem, air-gapped), broad IDE support (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio), and organization-aware completions that learn project patterns.
- Limitations: free/basic tier availability was reduced in 2025; on-prem/self-hosted deployments require operational expertise (Kubernetes, infra); most public performance benchmarks are vendor-provided — evaluate with a pilot before enterprise-wide roll-out.
- Ideal for: regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government, defense) and organizations that need data residency guarantees and enterprise governance.
