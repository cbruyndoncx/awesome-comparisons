## Description
Mistral Code is a packaged AI developer assistant designed for enterprise adoption. Announced in mid-2025, it combines multiple specialized models to handle code completion (Codestral), embeddings and code search (Codestral Embed), agentic multi-step developer tasks (Devstral), and chat-style assistance (Mistral Medium). The product emphasizes security, governance and observability: teams can run it in the cloud, on reserved capacity, or fully on-premises in air-gapped GPU environments so that source code never leaves company boundaries. It integrates with developer IDEs (private beta for VSCode and JetBrains via Continue), supports fine-tuning on private codebases, and provides admin controls, RBAC, audit logs, metrics, and approval workflows to fit regulated environments.

## BYOK
- Yes
  - Supports private deployments and enterprise key management practices through on-prem/air-gapped setups

## LocalOffline
- Yes
  Supports air-gapped on-premises GPU deployment for fully offline operation

## FreeTrial
- Yes
  Private beta availability; general availability and trial terms may vary

## GitSupport
- Yes
  Integrates with repositories for retrieval-augmented generation, code search, and fine-tuning

## Terminal
- Yes
  Agentic capabilities can reason over terminal output, run commands, and propose diffs under configurable approval flows

## Opensource
- No

## License
- Proprietary

## MCPSupport
- Yes
  - Assuming continue.dev functionality is kept - doublecheck

## Notes
- Core model stack: Codestral (autocomplete / fill-in-the-middle), Codestral Embed (embeddings / search), Devstral (agentic workflows), Mistral Medium (chat assistance).
- Built on top of the Continue open tooling for IDE integration (<https://continue.dev>), with private beta plugins for VSCode and JetBrains.
- Designed to address common enterprise blockers: connectivity & data residency, customization (fine-tuning), deeper task coverage (multi-step workflows), and consolidated SLAs.
- Adopted in production by organizations for hybrid/hardened deployments (examples reported: banks, large enterprises, system integrators).
- Not a drop-in open-source model; organizations seeking fully open-source stacks should evaluate the underlying Mistral model releases and Continue separately.
- Useful where governance, observability, and private-model customization are required for regulated codebases.
