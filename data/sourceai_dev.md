## Description
SourceAI is a web-based AI code generation tool that accepts natural language requests and returns generated code snippets across many programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.). The service advertises a simple, one-click interface targeted at making code generation accessible to both developers and non-developers. It uses large language models to interpret user intent and produce runnable code examples.

## Notes
- Core positioning: simplicity and speed â€” focused on quick, natural-language-to-code generation rather than deep IDE integrations or collaboration features.
- Technology: public-facing site indicates use of large language models (public references list GPT-3 / Codex as underlying tech in marketing/third-party summaries).
- Limitations: public documentation is sparse. There is no clear information on pricing, enterprise features, private model keys (BYOK), repository or IDE integrations, or offline/local deployment options.
- Example (from site marketing): Python factorial generator for a user-input number (simple, illustrative use case).
