## Extensible
- Yes
  - Platform API available for integrations and automation
## Description
v0 is an AI-first UI builder from Vercel that transforms natural-language prompts or Figma designs into working frontend components and small applications. It focuses on generating React components styled with Tailwind CSS (often using shadcn/ui patterns), provides an iterative chat interface for refinement, and integrates with Vercel deployment workflows. The product is aimed at speeding up prototyping and UI development while keeping outputs usable in real projects.
## BYOK

## LocalOffline
- No
  - v0 is a cloud service (web app and API). It does not run fully offline; model execution and generation happen on Vercel's servers.
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Freemium model / free tier available for evaluation
## GitSupport
- Yes
  - Integrates with GitHub and Vercel deployments for pushing generated projects and previewing sites
## Terminal
- No
  - Primary interface is web chat; platform/API can be integrated programmatically but there is no primary local CLI for generation
## Opensource
- No
  - The v0 product and its generation backend are proprietary; generated code is standard open-stack (React/Tailwind) that you can use in your own repos
## License
- Proprietary (Vercel)
## MCPSupport

## Notes
- Core strengths:
  - Fast design-to-code: accepts plain-English prompts or Figma uploads and returns React + Tailwind code
  - Iterative chat UX: keep context within a project chat to refine components and ask for fixes or new variants
  - Integration-ready: designed to fit into Vercel-hosted Next.js/React flows and can push code to GitHub for automatic deployments
  - Platform/API: offers a platform/API for building custom AI-assisted app builders or automations

- Typical outputs:
  - Component files (React + Tailwind), layout scaffolding, and style variants
  - Workable but often requires manual tuning for accessibility, edge-case logic, or complex interactions

- Pricing (subject to change):
  - Freemium tier exists for trial and light usage
  - Paid tiers provide larger "credits" allocation for higher-volume generation and team/enterprise features (team seats, SSO, audit logs, SLAs)
  - Exact pricing and credit rules change over timeâ€”check https://v0.dev or https://v0.app/pricing for the current plans

- Limitations and considerations:
  - Best for frontend UI generation and prototyping; not a full backend builder
  - Generated code should be reviewed for accessibility, security, and performance before shipping
  - Quality depends on prompt clarity; more detailed prompts yield better results

- Suggested workflow:
  1. Start a new v0 project/chat and describe the UI or upload a Figma frame
  2. Accept an initial draft, then iterate via chat commands (colors, spacing, interactions)
  3. Connect GitHub/Vercel to push generated code into a repo and enable preview deployments
  4. Review and refactor generated code as part of the normal code-review process
