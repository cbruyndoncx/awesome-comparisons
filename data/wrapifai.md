## Notes
- Primary use case: SEO and lead generation. Interactive tools increase time‑on‑site and can be optimized for keyword targets.
- UX: Drag‑and‑drop/no‑code builder → quick to launch; good for non‑technical users and marketers.
- Integrations: Embeds via script/iframe, email capture, webhooks; analytics for engagement and conversions.
- Pricing (reported in public materials during beta): starts at around $29/month for paid tier; tiering and limits apply.
- Limitations: Not intended for building full web applications or heavily customized backend logic. Customization beyond the provided builder can be limited; vendor lock‑in for hosted tools.
- Security: Platform claims encrypted transmission and secure storage for collected leads (standard for SaaS tools) — verify for specific compliance needs.
