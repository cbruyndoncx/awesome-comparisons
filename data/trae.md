## Description
Trae is an AI-first IDE intended to act as a full software engineering partner rather than only a completion tool. It is a fork of Visual Studio Code, so extensions, shortcuts and editor familiarity carry over. Trae provides multimodel access (examples: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro in early releases), integrated chat, builder/agent modes that plan and execute multi-file changes, SOLO mode for autonomous project delivery, and one-click web deployment (Vercel). It emphasizes planning-first workflows (Builder Mode) and agent-driven automation (SOLO and custom agents), plus multimodal inputs (screenshots/designs) and a bilingual interface (English and Simplified Chinese).

## BYOK

## GitSupport
- Yes

## Terminal
- Yes

## Opensource
- No

## License
- Proprietary

## MCPSupport
- Yes
  - Model Context Protocol support added in v1.3.0 to enable custom agents and richer context handling

## Notes
- Built on VS Code so migration is low-friction for users of VS Code or Cursor.
- Distinguishing features: Builder Mode (planning + controlled execution), SOLO Mode (autonomous project creation), multimodel access, and one-click Vercel deploys.
- Strong emphasis on end-to-end web development workflows with integrated previews, browser/webview support, and terminal integration.
- Supports multimodal inputs (screenshots, design assets) to inform coding and debugging.
- Privacy/Trust considerations: Proprietary product with cloud-hosted model usage â€” review organizational policy before use in sensitive codebases.
- Competitive positioning: Targets Cursor and GitHub Copilot users but differentiates on zero-cost premium-model access, autonomous agent flows, and built-in deployment tooling.
