## Description
From021 is a cloud SaaS product that automates the product-definition workflow: vision & goals, MVP prioritization, product requirements, user journeys and wireframes, implementation guidance, and AI prompt / ticket export. It generates Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), suggested tech stacks, data models, API endpoints, and exportable tickets or AI prompts to integrate with development tools and project management systems.

The platform emphasizes a structured process (uses MoSCoW prioritization) and targets agencies, product managers, and founders who want to compress weeks of planning into minutes. Outputs are aimed at making handoff to engineering faster and reducing ambiguity during execution.

## Notes
- Integrations / exports: the product advertises exports to project management and developer tools (examples mentioned: Trello, JIRA, v0, Lovable, Cursor) so it can fit into existing workflows for ticketing and prototype generation.
- Output types: PRDs, user flows, wireframes, tech stack recommendations, implementation guidelines, AI prompts for code assistants.
- Target users: Agencies (client scoping & handoff), Product Managers (fast PRD creation), Founders (rapid product definition and prioritization).
- Pricing & privacy: commercial SaaS; BYOK / self-hosting options are not publicly documented (leave as unknown). Users with strict data residency or security needs should contact From021 for details.
- Competitors / context: positioned near other AI-assisted product tools (e.g., ChatPRD) but focuses on structured customization and exportable developer artifacts rather than fully automatic summaries.



## ContextManagement
- Yes
  - Step-by-step product-definition UI (vision & goals, MVP prioritization, PRD generation) that captures and updates product context.
  - MoSCoW prioritization controls to manage feature importance within the project context.
  - Editable PRDs, user journeys and wireframes in the web UI; outputs can be revised and re-generated.
  - Export capabilities (PRDs, user stories, AI prompts, tickets) to external tools to persist context outside the platform.

## DirectFileReferences
- No
  - No public feature documented for directly referencing repository files or attaching arbitrary external files as "live" references in the product context; inputs are primarily web-form/text-driven with export connectors.

## Hooks
- No
  - No public developer hooks or lifecycle event attachments are documented for From021.

## SlashCommands
- No
  - There is no documentation of slash-commands or user-triggered reusable commands; interactions are performed through the web UI.

## Subagents
- No
  - From021 does not document the ability to define specialized AI subagents or task-specific agent workflows; AI appears to be built-in to the product flows.

## CustomModes
- No
  - There is no public support documented for creating persistent custom "modes" that change agent behavior; users can adjust inputs and settings per project to influence generated outputs.

## Plugins
- No
  - From021 does not expose a plugin system for bundling commands/agents/hooks. Integrations are provided as export connectors (examples: Trello, JIRA, v0, Lovable, Cursor) rather than a plugin marketplace or SDK.

## Checkpoints
- No
  - No explicit checkpoint/undo/versioning mechanism is documented publicly; inquire with the vendor for data retention, revision history, or rollback capabilities.

## SpecDrivenDevelopment
- Other
  - Not applicable â€” From021 is a SaaS product focused on product definition and does not advertise using the listed spec-driven development frameworks.
