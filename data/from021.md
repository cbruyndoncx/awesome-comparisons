## Description
From021 is a cloud SaaS product that automates the product-definition workflow: vision & goals, MVP prioritization, product requirements, user journeys and wireframes, implementation guidance, and AI prompt / ticket export. It generates Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), suggested tech stacks, data models, API endpoints, and exportable tickets or AI prompts to integrate with development tools and project management systems.

The platform emphasizes a structured process (uses MoSCoW prioritization) and targets agencies, product managers, and founders who want to compress weeks of planning into minutes. Outputs are aimed at making handoff to engineering faster and reducing ambiguity during execution.

- Output types: PRDs, user flows, wireframes, tech stack recommendations, implementation guidelines, AI prompts for code assistants.
- Target users: Agencies (client scoping & handoff), Product Managers (fast PRD creation), Founders (rapid product definition and prioritization).
- Pricing & privacy: commercial SaaS; BYOK / self-hosting options are not publicly documented (leave as unknown). Users with strict data residency or security needs should contact From021 for details.
- Competitors / context: positioned near other AI-assisted product tools (e.g., ChatPRD) but focuses on structured customization and exportable developer artifacts rather than fully automatic summaries.
