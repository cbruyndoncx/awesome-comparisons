## Description
Marblism provides two complementary offerings: (1) a suite of role-specific "AI Employees" (Eva, Penny, Sonny, Stan, Cara, Linda) that autonomously handle business tasks such as inbox/calendar triage, SEO blog writing, social scheduling, lead generation/outreach, customer support, and basic legal document review; and (2) an AI app builder that scaffolds full‑stack React + Node applications (DB schema, backend endpoints, front-end pages, auth, basic integrations) from prompts. The platform focuses on fast onboarding and autonomous operation for non-technical founders and small teams.

## Notes
- Primary value: replaces or augments routine human work for small teams (email, content, social, outreach, support) and accelerates prototyping for web apps.
- Notable AI Employees: Eva (assistant/inbox & calendar), Penny (SEO/blog), Sonny (social media), Stan (sales outreach), Cara (support), Linda (legal review).
- App builder features: creates DB schemas, backend APIs, front-end pages, authentication (JWT/Google), S3 uploads, mail integration; targeted at React + Node stacks.
- Pricing: positioned affordably (examples cited $39/month for unlimited AI Employees tasks); also offers tiered app-builder plans / free tier for limited use.
- Strengths: very fast prototyping, simple onboarding (<30 minutes), GitHub repo output, useful for MVPs and solo founders.
- Limitations: not enterprise-grade (compliance, on-premises), limited tech stack (React/Node), generated code usually needs manual review/hardening for production, documentation/support primarily community/Discord.
