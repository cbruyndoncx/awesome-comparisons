## Demo Script

### INTRODUCTION (15 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Let me show you how easy it is to find the perfect tool using Awesome Comparisons. Imagine you're looking for an AI code editor with specific requirements."

**Do:**
- Open browser to comparison view
- Ensure "Code/Editors" dataset is selected
- Gesture to the interface

**Screen Shows:**
- Full comparison table with all AI code editors
- Multiple columns of criteria
- Clean, organized interface

---

### STEP 1: Apply First Filter - Offline Capability (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "First, I know I need offline capability. Let me filter by that criterion."

**Do:**
1. Locate the filter controls (sidebar or dropdown filters)
2. Find "Local/Offline" or similar criterion in the filter panel
3. Select "Yes" or "Supported" from the dropdown/checkbox
4. Pause to show results

**Screen Shows:**
- Table filters to show only items with offline capability
- Filter indicator showing "Local/Offline: Yes"
- Reduced number of items (from 30+ to ~8-10)

**Tip the Audience:**
> "Notice how the table instantly updates to show only tools that support offline mode. We've already narrowed down from over 30 tools to just about 8 candidates."

---

### STEP 2: Add Second Filter - BYOK (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Now I need tools that support 'Bring Your Own Key' - meaning I can use my own API keys. Let me add that filter."

**Do:**
1. In the filter panel, find "BYOK" or "Bring Your Own Key" criterion
2. Select "Yes" from the dropdown or check the checkbox
3. Pause as the table updates
4. Show the filtered results

**Alternative** (depending on UI):
- Expand "Deployment" or "Features" filter group
- Select "BYOK = Yes" option
- Apply filter

**Screen Shows:**
- Further reduced list (now ~5-7 items)
- Multiple filter indicators visible: "Local/Offline: Yes" and "BYOK: Yes"
- All remaining items have both features

**Tip the Audience:**
> "We're now down to just the tools that support both offline mode AND bring-your-own-key. Stacking filters like this quickly narrows down our options."

---

### STEP 3: Add Third Filter - Git Support (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Finally, I need strong Git integration. Let's add that filter."

**Do:**
1. In the filter panel, find "Git Support" criterion
2. Select "Full integration" or "Yes" from the dropdown
3. Pause as table updates to show final filtered results

**Screen Shows:**
- Final list of ~3-5 tools
- Three filter indicators visible: "Local/Offline: Yes", "BYOK: Yes", "Git Support: Yes"
- All remaining tools match all three criteria

**Tip the Audience:**
> "Perfect! Now we're down to just 3-4 tools that match all our requirements. Three filters applied, and we went from 30+ tools to our perfect shortlist."

---

### STEP 4: Compare Top 3 (45 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Let me explore the top three candidates in more detail."

**Do:**
1. Click on the first item name (e.g., "Cline")
2. Detail panel opens (sidebar or modal)
3. Scroll through the details briefly
4. Point out key information:
   - Rating: 4.5 stars
   - All our required features
   - Repository link
   - Additional capabilities

5. Click "Next" or close and open another item
6. Repeat for 2-3 items

**Screen Shows:**
- Detailed view with full description
- All criteria organized by groups
- Links to documentation/repository
- Easy navigation between items

**Tip the Audience:**
> "The detail view shows everything about each tool, organized into logical groups. I can click through to the repository or documentation from here."

---

### STEP 5: Export for Team Review (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Now I want to share this comparison with my team. Let me export it to Excel."

**Do:**
1. Click the "Export" button
2. File downloads automatically
3. (Optional) Open the Excel file briefly
4. Show that it contains:
   - All filtered items
   - All visible criteria
   - Clean formatting

**Screen Shows:**

---

### CONCLUSION (15 seconds)

**Say:**
> "And that's it! In less than 3 minutes, we went from 30+ tools down to our top 3 candidates, reviewed them in detail, and exported for team discussion. That's the power of Awesome Comparisons."

**Do:**
- Return to main comparison view
- Show the filtered results one more time
- Smile and open for questions

## Key Talking Points

### During the Demo, Emphasize:

1. **Speed**: "Notice how fast this is - no page reloads, instant filtering"

2. **Intuitive Interface**: "Clear filter options let you narrow down by any criterion"

3. **Multiple Filters**: "Stack as many filters as you need - the system handles complex queries"

4. **Detail on Demand**: "Quick overview in the table, deep dive in the details"

5. **Export Freedom**: "Take the data with you - no lock-in"

---

## Handling Common Questions

### Q: "Can I save my filters?"
**A:** "Currently, the URL updates with your filters, so you can bookmark or share the link. A saved filters feature is on the roadmap."

### Q: "What if I want to compare items from different datasets?"
**A:** "The 'All' dataset view shows items across all comparisons. You can also export from multiple datasets and combine in Excel."

### Q: "How often is the data updated?"
**A:** "That depends on the maintainers of each dataset, but typically it's updated weekly or when new tools are released."

### Q: "Can I add my own tool to the comparison?"
**A:** "Absolutely! Our Tutorial Track B shows how to add entries. It's just a simple markdown file."

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### Issue: No Results After Filtering
- **Fix**: Remove one filter to see if it's too restrictive
- **Say**: "Looks like these criteria are too specific. Let me adjust one filter..."

### Issue: Filters Don't Seem to Work
- **Fix**: Refresh page, clear all filters, try again
- **Say**: "Let me reset the filters and start fresh..."

### Issue: Export Doesn't Download
- **Fix**: Check browser pop-up blocker
- **Say**: "Ah, looks like my browser blocked the download. Let me allow it..."

### Issue: Detail View Doesn't Open
- **Fix**: Click the item name, not the row
- **Say**: "Let me click directly on the name here..."
