## Demo Script

### INTRODUCTION (15 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Let me show you how easy it is to find the perfect tool using Awesome Comparisons. Imagine you're looking for an AI code editor with specific requirements."

**Do:**
- Open browser to comparison view
- Ensure "Code/Editors" dataset is selected
- Gesture to the interface

**Screen Shows:**
- Full comparison table with all AI code editors
- Multiple columns of criteria
- Clean, organized interface

---

### STEP 1: Start with Search (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "First, I know I need offline capability. Let's search for 'offline'."

**Do:**
1. Click in the search box at the top
2. Type: `offline`
3. Press Enter (or wait for auto-search)
4. Pause to show results

**Screen Shows:**
- Table filters to show only items mentioning "offline"
- Highlighted search term (if implemented)
- Reduced number of items (from 30+ to ~8-10)

**Tip the Audience:**
> "Notice how the search looks across all criteria, not just the name. It found tools that mention offline in their features, descriptions, or capabilities."

---

### STEP 2: Add First Filter - BYOK (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Now I need tools that support 'Bring Your Own Key' - meaning I can use my own API keys. Let me filter by BYOK."

**Do:**
1. Look for the "BYOK" or "Deployment" criteria column
2. Click on column header or use filter panel
3. Select "Yes" for BYOK
4. Show the filtered results

**Alternative** (if filter UI differs):
- Use the filter sidebar
- Expand "Deployment" or "Features" group
- Check "BYOK = Yes"

**Screen Shows:**
- Further reduced list (now ~5-7 items)
- All remaining items have BYOK = Yes

**Tip the Audience:**
> "We're now down to just the tools that support both offline mode AND bring-your-own-key."

---

### STEP 3: Add Second Filter - Git Support (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Finally, I need strong Git integration. Let's add that filter."

**Do:**
1. Find "Git Support" criterion
2. Filter for "Full integration" or "Yes" (depending on data)
3. Show final filtered results

**Screen Shows:**
- Final list of ~3-5 tools
- All match all three criteria

**Tip the Audience:**
> "Perfect! Now we're down to just 3-4 tools that match all our requirements. Let's take a closer look."

---

### STEP 4: Compare Top 3 (45 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Let me explore the top three candidates in more detail."

**Do:**
1. Click on the first item name (e.g., "Cline")
2. Detail panel opens (sidebar or modal)
3. Scroll through the details briefly
4. Point out key information:
   - Rating: 4.5 stars
   - All our required features
   - Repository link
   - Additional capabilities

5. Click "Next" or close and open another item
6. Repeat for 2-3 items

**Screen Shows:**
- Detailed view with full description
- All criteria organized by groups
- Links to documentation/repository
- Easy navigation between items

**Tip the Audience:**
> "The detail view shows everything about each tool, organized into logical groups. I can click through to the repository or documentation from here."

---

### STEP 5: Export for Team Review (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Now I want to share this comparison with my team. Let me export it to Excel."

**Do:**
1. Click the "Export" button
2. File downloads automatically
3. (Optional) Open the Excel file briefly
4. Show that it contains:
   - All filtered items
   - All visible criteria
   - Clean formatting

**Screen Shows:**
- Export button highlighted
- Download notification
- (If opened) Excel spreadsheet with comparison data

**Tip the Audience:**
> "The export creates a snapshot of exactly what I'm seeing - just the filtered items with all their details. Perfect for sharing with the team or for offline review."

---

### CONCLUSION (15 seconds)

**Say:**
> "And that's it! In less than 3 minutes, we went from 30+ tools down to our top 3 candidates, reviewed them in detail, and exported for team discussion. That's the power of Awesome Comparisons."

**Do:**
- Return to main comparison view
- Show the filtered results one more time
- Smile and open for questions

## Key Talking Points

### During the Demo, Emphasize:

1. **Speed**: "Notice how fast this is - no page reloads, instant filtering"

2. **Flexibility**: "You can search for anything - features, names, descriptions"

3. **Multiple Filters**: "Stack as many filters as you need - the system handles complex queries"

4. **Detail on Demand**: "Quick overview in the table, deep dive in the details"

5. **Export Freedom**: "Take the data with you - no lock-in"

---

## Handling Common Questions

### Q: "Can I save my filters?"
**A:** "Currently, the URL updates with your filters, so you can bookmark or share the link. A saved filters feature is on the roadmap."

### Q: "What if I want to compare items from different datasets?"
**A:** "The 'All' dataset view shows items across all comparisons. You can also export from multiple datasets and combine in Excel."

### Q: "How often is the data updated?"
**A:** "That depends on the maintainers of each dataset, but typically it's updated weekly or when new tools are released."

### Q: "Can I add my own tool to the comparison?"
**A:** "Absolutely! Our Tutorial Track B shows how to add entries. It's just a simple markdown file."

---

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### Issue: Search Returns No Results
- **Fix**: Clear search and try a synonym
- **Say**: "Looks like we need to adjust our search term..."

### Issue: Filters Don't Seem to Work
- **Fix**: Refresh page, try again
- **Say**: "Let me reset the filters and start fresh..."

### Issue: Export Doesn't Download
- **Fix**: Check browser pop-up blocker
- **Say**: "Ah, looks like my browser blocked the download. Let me allow it..."

### Issue: Detail View Doesn't Open
- **Fix**: Click the item name, not the row
- **Say**: "Let me click directly on the name here..."
