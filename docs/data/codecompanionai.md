## Description
CodeCompanion.ai (desktop) is described in third-party write-ups as a local-first AI coding assistant powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. It provides a chat interface that can read and reason about a user's codebase, generate and update files, run shell commands, assist with project setup and dependency installation, and translate natural language to SQL for database queries. The application emphasizes developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks and allowing commands to be executed from within the app.

## BYOK
- Yes

## LocalOffline
- No
  - [All user data (code, DBs, etc.) is described as being stored locally on the user's machine, but the assistant makes API calls to OpenAI for model inference â€” so it is not fully offline.]

## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - [The product is often described as using the user's own OpenAI API key (BYOK) which enables usage without a separate paid tier from the vendor; however any model usage will consume the user's OpenAI quota which may incur cost.]

## GitSupport
- Yes

## Terminal
- Yes

## Opensource
- No

## License


## MCP-Client


## Notes
- Privacy: Multiple sources emphasize a local-first design where code and data remain on the user's machine; network calls appear limited to OpenAI API usage.
- Features reported: semantic code search, natural-language-to-SQL, integrated terminal, Git integration, project scaffolding, file creation and updates, ability to execute shell commands and read outputs.
- Pricing/details: I could not find an official pricing page or clear subscription tiers in the public third-party descriptions. The vendor appears to support BYOK (use your OpenAI API key), which means costs for model usage are borne by the user via their OpenAI account.
- Open-source status: No authoritative indication that the desktop app is open source. There is an unrelated community project named codecompanion.nvim (a Neovim plugin) on GitHub; do not confuse the two.
- Documentation: Public, authoritative documentation or an official product site with detailed specs/pricing was not discovered in the sources I reviewed. Recommend checking the vendor domain (https://codecompanion.ai) and any official docs or contact channels for the latest details before deployment or purchase.
