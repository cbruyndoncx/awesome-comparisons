## Extensible
- Yes

## Description
Windsurf is an AI-powered, agentic development environment (IDE-like) designed to understand entire codebases, perform multi-file edits, and run iterative "AI flows" that plan, modify, and validate changes across a project. It emphasizes deep indexing of repositories to provide context-aware code generation (not just token-level autocomplete), memory of project and team preferences, and integration with terminals and development workflows. Windsurf evolved from previous offerings in the space (notably Codeium-era projects) and targets both individual developers and teams who want higher-level automation and collaboration between humans and AI.

## BYOK
- Yes

## LocalOffline
- No
  - Windsurf is primarily a cloud-hosted agent; local/offline modes are limited compared with some local-first tools (though integrations and enterprise offerings may offer stronger controls).
## FreeTrial
- Yes
## GitSupport
- Yes
## Terminal
- Yes
## Opensource
- No
## License
- Proprietary
## MCP-Client
- Yes
## Notes
- Core features: Cascade (agentic flows with Write Mode and Chat Mode) with MCP support, Supercomplete (intent-aware completions across files), memory for team/project preferences, deep indexing for semantic repo understanding, multi-file edits, and terminal integration.
- Workflow: Windsurf indexes the repository to build a semantic map, then offers both targeted inline edits and larger multi-file changes through planned flows that can ask for confirmations and iteratively validate results.
- Use cases: rapid feature development, refactoring across large codebases, onboarding and enabling non-technical stakeholders to participate in app development, automated bug fixing and repeated task automation.
- Positioning: competes with agentic IDEs and advanced copilots (e.g., Cursor AI and other commercial copilots) by focusing on whole-project context and automated multi-file transformations.
- Privacy & controls: offers enterprise features (including BYOK) to help with key management; however, as a proprietary cloud service it may not meet all offline/local security needs.
- Background: built on advances in code-level LLM tooling; product messaging highlights agentic behavior (planning, execution, checkpoints) rather than only completion.
- Community artifacts: there are community-driven helper files and rules (e.g., .windsurfrules) circulated to help guide AI assistants on code style and project rules; these can be found in various GitHub repos but the main product is not open-source.
