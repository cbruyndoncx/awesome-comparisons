## Description
GitHub Copilot is a cloud-hosted AI coding assistant from GitHub (Microsoft) that provides inline code completions, whole-function and multi-file suggestions, a conversational Copilot Chat interface, and autonomous coding agent features. It leverages multiple large models (including GPT-family and Claude models) to offer natural-language-to-code generation, contextual completions based on repository contents, and developer workflows such as generating pull requests, writing tests, and refactoring.

Copilot is positioned as an AI pair programmer: suggestions appear as you type in supported editors, and Copilot Chat enables interactive Q&A and multi-file code transformations. Enterprise offerings add organization-level controls, knowledge bases for chat context, and workflow features that let Copilot act on GitHub issues and propose pull requests.
## BYOK
- No
  - No public, general-purpose "bring your own key" option for the cloud-hosted Copilot service. Enterprise plans provide data controls and policy management but do not expose a documented BYOK for model keys as of 2025-10-19.
## LocalOffline
- No
  - Any offline/local-only model hosting is not offered for the standard Copilot cloud service. Some organizations use enterprise features to limit data sharing; however, Copilot itself runs in GitHub/Microsoft cloud.
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Copilot has free tiers (e.g., Copilot Free for qualifying users) and trial/paid plans (Pro/Business/Enterprise) with different capabilities.
## GitSupport
- Yes
  - Integrates with GitHub workflows: PR description generation, PR creation by the Copilot agent, and issue-to-PR workflows in enterprise features.
## Terminal
- Yes
  - Copilot Chat is available in supported terminals (Windows Terminal Canary, GitHub CLI integrations) and can be used from the command line in supported environments.
## Opensource
- No
## License
- Proprietary
## MCP-Client
- Yes
## Notes
- Copilot provides model selection and multi-model access (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude variants) in certain plans; model availability varies by tier.
- Copilot Chat supports multi-file edits from a single prompt and can incorporate repository context and organization knowledge bases in Enterprise.
- The Copilot autonomous coding agent can be assigned GitHub issues and produce pull requests for review; this increases automation but requires careful review for correctness and security.
- Privacy/data usage: Enterprise tiers offer stronger controls and indemnity options; evaluate data residency and IP policies if using Copilot on proprietary codebases.
