## Description
Replit Ghostwriter is a proprietary, cloud-based AI coding assistant built into the Replit online IDE. It offers inline code completions and suggestions, natural-language code generation, explainers that walk through code, and transformation/refactor capabilities. Ghostwriter is tightly integrated with Replit features (editor, shell, deployments, collaboration) so developers can iterate, share, and deploy from the browser with minimal setup.

Ghostwriter focuses on developer productivity in an always-online environment — useful for students, educators, hackathons, prototypes, and fast single-developer projects. It does not provide a local/offline model bundle and does not expose the underlying model weights or detailed model names in public documentation.

## Notes
- Key features: "Complete Code" (inline suggestions), "Explain Code" (natural-language explanations), "Transform Code" (refactors/rewrites), and "Generate Code" (from prompts).
- Pricing is tiered: Starter (free) with limited resources; Core (individual pro tier, commonly around $20/month with monthly credits when billed annually); Teams (team plans around $35/user/month annually with extra credits and collaboration features); Enterprise (custom pricing, SSO/SCIM and enterprise controls available).
- Billing uses a credit model: agent/AI compute, deployments and some resources consume credits; heavy usage can increase costs beyond subscription fees.
- Deployments: static deploys can be free but autoscale/reserved VM deployments carry additional costs starting from low-dollar/month tiers upward.
- Privacy/enterprise controls: enterprise plans advertise SSO and provisioning (SAML/SCIM). Public docs do not disclose BYOK, data residency or detailed data-retention controls — contact Replit sales for enterprise privacy/data-residency specifics.
- Models and internals: Replit does not publicly document exact model names or weights used by Ghostwriter; descriptions reference "frontier" or large-generation models in marketing material.
- Use cases: excellent for browser-first workflows, teaching, pair-programming, quick refactors and prototyping. Not suitable when strict on-premises, BYOK, or fully offline operation is required.
- Recommendation: for teams with strict compliance needs, engage Replit Enterprise sales to confirm options (SSO, data handling, contractual terms). For individual users, Core provides a convenient integrated experience with monthly usage credits.
