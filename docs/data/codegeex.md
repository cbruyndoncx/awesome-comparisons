## Description
CodeGeeX is a large-scale multilingual code generation model and toolkit developed by THUDM. It was trained on a massive corpus covering source code and natural language across many programming languages to support code generation, translation (crossâ€‘language), completion, summarization, and explanation. The project provides model checkpoints (for research use), inference scripts, and IDE integrations (for example, a VS Code extension).
## BYOK
- No
## LocalOffline
- Yes
  - Model can be run locally for research/inference with appropriate GPU hardware; supports NVIDIA GPUs and Huawei Ascend platforms (weights are large and require significant memory).
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - Model code is open-source; weights are available for academic research. Commercial use of weights typically requires registration/approval per THUDM's model license terms.
## GitSupport
- No
## Terminal
- No
## Opensource
- Yes
## License
- Code: Apache-2.0
- Model weights: released for academic research; commercial use requires application/approval (see repository for details)
## MCP-Client

## Notes
- Trained at large scale (reported training on 850B+ tokens and large TPU/Ascend clusters in original publications) and evaluated with a multilingual HumanEval-X benchmark.
- Provides cross-language code translation and multilingual code generation capabilities; reported strong performance compared to contemporaneous open models.
- IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains) exist to make the model usable as a coding assistant; downstream usage may be subject to the model weights' licensing terms.
- For commercial deployment, review the repository's instructions and registration process for obtaining the model weights.
- See also: CodeGeeX2 (follow-up) and related THUDM releases which may have differing licenses or access requirements.
