# Refraction - https://refraction.dev
A small, practical AI assistant for developers focused on refactoring, test generation, documentation, and small code transforms rather than real-time in-editor completions.

## Description
Refraction is a web-first AI development assistant (refraction.dev) which helps developers automate repetitive tasks: generate unit tests, add or improve documentation, refactor and clean code, generate regular expressions, convert small code snippets between languages, and produce short code implementations from natural-language prompts. It is positioned for improving existing code and producing targeted outputs rather than acting as a continuous real-time code completion engine.

## Notes
- Pricing: consumer/pro plan pricing reported in public materials at roughly $8/month for the Pro (unlimited generations) tier; Team and Enterprise tiers are available with additional collaboration, billing and SSO/SCIM/audit features.
- Strengths: fast, focused tooling for test generation, documentation, refactors and small code transforms; broad language coverage (56 languages); inexpensive compared with many other AI-dev assistants.
- Limitations: not open-source, hosted (no obvious offline/local mode), limited real-time in-editor pairing (itâ€™s oriented around discrete generations rather than streaming in-line completions like Copilot), and limited public detail about the exact underlying model(s) (no explicit, verifiable public claim that it runs on a specific third-party model such as OpenAI).
- Data & privacy: product materials indicate generations and history are stored to provide a History feature; check Refraction's privacy policy / terms for details before sending sensitive code.
- Use-cases: adding unit tests, documenting legacy code, refactoring for clarity or minor performance improvements, generating regexes and language-to-language snippet translations.
