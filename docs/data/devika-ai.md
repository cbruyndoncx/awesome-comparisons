## Description
Devika AI is an open-source "software engineer" agent that accepts high-level instructions, creates plans, researches needed information, and implements code across projects. It emphasizes multi-model support (cloud LLMs and local LLMs via Ollama), agentic planning and reasoning, project-based organization, and automation of development tasks including coding, testing, and deployment.

Key capabilities include automated planning (breaking objectives into actionable steps), web research (browse and extract relevant docs), code generation across multiple languages/stack contexts, repository/Git integration, and deployment helpers (for example, static site deployment to Netlify).
## BYOK
- Yes
  - Supports configuring API keys/endpoints for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Bing/Google search, Ollama, etc.
## LocalOffline
- Yes
## FreeTrial
- Yes
  - The project is open-source and free to run; commercial clouds/models used via BYOK may incur costs.
## GitSupport
- Yes
  - Integrates with project repositories and can perform Git operations as part of its workflows.
## Terminal
- Yes
  - Provides CLI and web UI components; integrates with local runtimes (Bun, Ollama) and shells for execution.
## Opensource
- Yes
## License
- See repository for exact license
## MCPSupport
- Yes
## Notes
- Multi-model support: commonly used with Claude 3, GPT-4, Gemini, Mistral, Groq and local models via Ollama.
- Requirements: commonly references Bun (JavaScript runtime), Ollama for local LLMs, Git, and standard development tooling.
- Project organization: project-based workspace model with persistent state and task tracking so agents can continue work across sessions.
- Research and browsing: built-in research module for fetching and summarizing web documentation, API references, and examples.
- Use cases: full-stack feature implementation, repo maintenance, automated testing, documentation generation, and static site deployment.
- Community & contribution: open-source repo on GitHub encourages contributions; check repository for issues, contribution guidelines and exact license details.
