# Update YOUR Comparison (v3)

This guide explains how to set up or update a comparison to work with v3 of the Ultimate Comparison Framework.

## Quick start â€” create a new dataset

1. Create a directory for your dataset and initialize the comparison skeleton (example):

```bash
mkdir -p datasets/my-comparison
cd datasets/my-comparison
# create description.md and a comparison.yml or dataset.yaml as required
```

2. Add your comparison data files (markdown entries) under the dataset directory.

3. Add a `dataset.yaml` (or `dataset.json`) descriptor with at least `id` and `path`.

4. Add an entry at the top level `datasets:` config pointing to your dataset so tools can discover it.

## Configuration overview

- Put configuration pieces under `configuration/` and use `sources.configDefaults` in dataset manifest entries to reuse shared config fragments.
- Each dataset can override default configuration keys by providing a local `comparison.yml` (or `comparison-default.yml`) inside the dataset folder.

## Repo field / repository-dependent columns

If you use repository-aware columns (where the column depends on a repository URL), include a `## Repo` section in your markdown entries with the repo URL as the first list item.

Example entry snippet:

```markdown
## Repo
- https://github.com/your/project

## ShortDescription
- This is an example entry
```


## Running & developing locally

- Ensure you have a node_modules directory (run `npm install` in the top-level repository if needed).
- Start the demo with dataset selection if available (check your package.json scripts). Typical command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --dataset my-comparison
```

or for per-dataset builds:

```bash
npm run build -- --dataset my-comparison
```


## Notes on md2json (data conversion)

The md -> JSON conversion is handled automatically during the data preparation step (`npm run data:prepare` / `npm run data:watch`). The project includes npm scripts to compile and run the md2json converter (TypeScript) as part of the normal data preparation workflow, so setting an environment variable such as `MD_TO_JSON_COMMAND` is not required.

If you are running builds or CI in a fresh environment, ensure your job runs the `data:prepare` step (or the equivalent npm script) so the converter is compiled and the datasets are transformed into the JSON artifacts the demo consumes.

Example (local):

```bash
# prepare data (compiles converter if needed, then converts markdown to JSON)
npm run data:prepare
```

If you prefer to provide a custom converter, add or override a script in package.json (for example, an `md2json:run` script) and call it from your build steps.

## Where to put descriptions and table configuration

- `description.md` in your dataset folder controls the site description for that dataset.
- `comparison.yml` controls criteria, ordering and table fields. See `configuration/` for examples.
