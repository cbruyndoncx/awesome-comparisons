## Issue #3: Fix Product Confusion in Claude Desktop SpecDrivenDevelopment Section

**File:** `datasets/code-agent/data/claude-desktop.md`
**Severity:** Critical - Wrong Product
**Priority:** P1

### Description

Lines 136-153 discuss Claude Code features, not Claude Desktop. Two different products are being conflated. The SpecDrivenDevelopment section should focus on Claude Desktop capabilities only.

### Action Required

- [ ] Remove all Claude Code-specific content from Claude Desktop file
- [ ] Research and document Claude Desktop's actual spec-driven development support
- [ ] Keep focus on Claude Desktop features only

### Files to Update

- `datasets/code-agent/data/claude-desktop.md` (Lines 136-153)
