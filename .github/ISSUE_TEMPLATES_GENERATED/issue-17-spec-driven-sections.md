## Issue #17: Complete Empty SpecDrivenDevelopment Sections

**Files:** amp.md, mutableai.md
**Severity:** Low - Incomplete Data
**Priority:** P7

### Description

- amp.md (Lines 137-140): Completely empty with just `---`

### Action Required

- [ ] Research spec-driven development support for each tool
- [ ] If no support, explicitly state "No support for listed frameworks"
- [ ] Remove duplicate sections
- [ ] Ensure consistent approach across all files

### Files to Update

- `datasets/code-agent/data/amp.md` (Lines 137-140)
- `datasets/code-agent/data/mutableai.md` (Lines 132-143)
